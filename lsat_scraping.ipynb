       "[Question 1. Tempest: I bought two urns from an auction at Christie’s. Christie’s advertised them as dating from the Louis XV period of the late 18th century. I now believe that they actually date from the late 19th century and are worth much less than I paid for them. Several antiques experts agree with me. Therefore, Christie’s advertised them falsely and should refund my purchase price.\n",
       " Answer A. The auction catalog described the urns as \"A pair of Louis XV porphyry and gilt-bronze two-handled vases.\"\n",
       " Answer B. Dating antiques is an imprecise art, and often, several experts disagree about the date of origin of the same item.\n",
       " Answer C. Scientists have performed tests on the bronze linings of the urns, but they have not produced conclusive results regarding the vases' ages.\n",
       " Answer D. Christie's states in its auction catalogs that all buyers should consult outside specialists before bidding on antiques, especially in the case of extremely valuable items.\n",
       " Answer E. The experts who Tempest hired to date the urns are known as some of the best in their field.,\n",
       " Question 2. The state should continue to use the death penalty to punish the most extreme criminals. The death penalty is the only way to provide closure for the families of victims. People who commit coldblooded, premeditated murders are incorrigible. Anyone whom a jury convicts of committing a truly heinous crime deserves to be executed by the state.\n",
       " Answer A. Surveys of the families of murder victims show that the surviving relatives overwhelmingly support the death penalty.\n",
       " Answer B. Simply executing convicted criminals is far cheaper than maintaining them in maximum-security prison for life, with no chance of release or parole.\n",
       " Answer C. Recent studies have shown that a large proportion of criminals sentenced to death are later shown to be innocent of their crimes.\n",
       " Answer D. Modern methods of execution such as lethal injection are much less unpleasant to watch than earlier methods such as electrocution or hanging.\n",
       " Answer E. Many states that had supported the death penalty are now moving in the other direction, and the number of executions has decreased dramatically in recent years.,\n",
       " Question 3. The top-ranking, highest-paying law firms select their new associates exclusively from top-ten law schools. Therefore, if a student does not get into a top-ten law school, he or she should not bother attending law school at all.\n",
       " Answer A. promises students that if they attend a top-ten law school, they are guaranteed a position at a top-ranking law firm\n",
       " Answer B. suggests, without offering evidence, that the legal education provided by lower-ranking law schools is inadequate\n",
       " Answer C. fails to criticize the biased recruiting practices of top-ranking law firms\n",
       " Answer D. assumes that the only reason anyone would attend law school is to acquire a job at a top-ranking, high-paying law firm\n",
       " Answer E. misrepresents the relationship between law school and future employment,\n",
       " Question 4. Exterminator: In the summer, we implement a large-scale mosquito abatement program to protect the human population from West Nile virus. In addition to spraying insecticide and larvicide to kill mosquitoes, we also collect dead birds and test them for the virus. We have not found the virus in any birds tested this year, so there will not be an outbreak of West Nile virus in humans this summer.\n",
       " Answer A. Mosquitoes transmit the virus to birds by biting them, which is the same way humans catch the virus, but birds are much more susceptible than humans to dying from West Nile virus.\n",
       " Answer B. The massive spraying of insecticide and larvicide will be more effective this year than in previous years.\n",
       " Answer C. Birds are the only indicator species of West Nile virus for humans.\n",
       " Answer D. It is possible to have an outbreak of West Nile virus among humans, even if no birds die of the virus, though that would be an unusual scenario.\n",
       " Answer E. The insecticide and larvicide used to kill the adult and larval mosquitoes do not have a deleterious effect on the health of birds that eat mosquitoes.,\n",
       " Question 5. Editorialist: Conservative legislators and religious groups want to ban all research involving undifferentiated stem cells, fearing that such research would be akin to abortion because it would destroy an embryo’s chances at life. They could not be more wrong; stem cells are not embryos and can never develop into human beings. Stem cell research could lead to all sorts of promising treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and some kinds of cancer.\n",
       " Answer A. Stem cell research should not be banned.\n",
       " Answer B. Stem cells research would not result in the destruction of embryos.\n",
       " Answer C. Stem cell research offers many powerful benefits.\n",
       " Answer D. Some legislators are pushing for a ban against research on undifferentiated cells.\n",
       " Answer E. Any research that leads to promising treatments should not be banned.,\n",
       " Question 6. Scientists have concluded that a pickled human heart long believed to be the heart of King Louis XVII of France is indeed his heart, and not that of a commoner substituted for the royal boy. Louis XVII’s parents, Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, fell to the guillotine during the French Revolution, and Louis XVII was thrown into prison, where he died at the age of 10. His heart was removed and preserved. Many people believed, however, that the young king had been spirited away and the boy who died in prison was an impostor. Scientific evidence now shows that the child who died in prison was indeed Louis XVII.\n",
       " Answer A. At that time in France, removing and preserving the hearts of royal corpses was a traditional service that was never applied to the bodies of commoners.\n",
       " Answer B. Scientists examining the heart have concluded that it must have belonged to a male between the ages of 8 and 12.\n",
       " Answer C. DNA samples taken from the heart in question and from hair cut from Marie Antoinette's head when she was a child indicate that the heart and hair sample came from people who were closely related.\n",
       " Answer D. The doctor who removed Louis XVII's heart preserved it in a jar of alcohol, which was so effective as a preservative that the heart's valves and muscles are still in good condition and can be easily examined by scientists.\n",
       " Answer E. Scientists examining the heart have determined that it came from a child who suffered great physical privation in the years just prior to his death; in particular, its undeveloped muscles suggest that the heart's owner did not engage in much physical activity for several years.,\n",
       " Question 7. Emilio: Every child should be encouraged to play a single team sport at a high level, perhaps on a select traveling team that plays year-round. If a child does not play on an elite team at a young age, he will not have a chance to play on his high school varsity team and will thus forgo any opportunity to win college scholarships for athletics.\n",
       " Answer A. sports teach children teamwork and leadership\n",
       " Answer B. children who play a single sport on an elite team enjoy themselves\n",
       " Answer C. parents should encourage their children to participate in organized sports\n",
       " Answer D. early specialization in a single sport is beneficial to children\n",
       " Answer E. children below high school age should be participating in organized sports,\n",
       " Question 8. To preserve the flavor of food for the longest period of time, a home freezer should maintain a temperature of no greater than 0 degrees. Even food that is kept frozen at the proper temperature lasts no more than a year. For every 5 degrees of temperature above zero, the life of food is cut in half. Most home freezers maintain a temperature of about 10 degrees.\n",
       " Answer A. Most home freezers can store food for no more than three months.\n",
       " Answer B. Most homeowners do not know the temperature of their freezers.\n",
       " Answer C. Frozen foods can still be safe to eat, even when they have lost their optimum flavor.\n",
       " Answer D. Commercial freezers stay colder than home freezers.\n",
       " Answer E. Most food in home freezers has been kept past the point at which its best flavor begins to deteriorate.,\n",
       " Question 9. Ichthyologist: I have discovered a new kind of mollusk that lives deep in the ocean. All animals that live in the deep sea are predators that eat other animals. Therefore, this new mollusk must be a predator.\n",
       " Answer A. A yoga enthusiast discovers a new yoga studio. All yoga studios employ experienced and highly trained instructors. Therefore, the yoga enthusiast will be able to find a good instructor.\n",
       " Answer B. A coach finds a talented new basketball player in Croatia. Most Croatian basketball players are tall and hardworking. Therefore, this new basketball player is tall and hardworking.\n",
       " Answer C. A gardener discovers a new variety of tomato in his garden. All tomatoes are members of the same family as potatoes and eggplants, the nightshade family. Therefore, this tomato must be a member of the nightshade family.\n",
       " Answer D. A jeweler finds a perfect sapphire. All sapphires are very hard and durable. Therefore, this sapphire must be hard and durable.\n",
       " Answer E. A botanist finds a new kind of cactus in the driest part of the desert. All plants that live in the dry desert are extremely efficient at collecting and retaining water. Therefore, this new cactus must be extremely efficient at collecting and retaining water.,\n",
       " Question 10. Counselor: People should always pick their battles. By bringing up only the issues that truly matter to them and ignoring the ones that don’t, they maximize chances of getting what they want and avoid antagonizing friends and relatives unnecessarily.\n",
       " Answer A. A brother and sister have to share a car. The brother never fills the tank with gasoline, always driving it until it is nearly empty and then waiting for his sister to fill it up. She yells at him every time she has to visit a gas station.\n",
       " Answer B. A wife wants her husband to wash the dishes, take out the garbage, and make the bed in the morning, but she knows he will not do all three. She most dislikes taking out the garbage herself, so she makes a point of asking him to do that many times and ignores the dishes and bed.\n",
       " Answer C. A test-prep teacher teaching an LSAT course wants to improve her students' scores in both logical reasoning and analytical reasoning, but she does not have time to do a thorough job on both, so she spends half her time on logical reasoning and half on analytical reasoning.\n",
       " Answer D. A bride's mother wants her to have a big wedding in a church followed by a large reception, but the bride wants a small, less-formal wedding with just a few guests. They cannot agree, so the bride and groom decide to elope instead.\n",
       " Answer E. A father wants his son to win an athletic scholarship and insists that his son spend hours every afternoon working out and practicing sports. Despite the son's strenuous efforts, he fails to win an athletic scholarship. Because he is a good student, though, he does win an academic scholarship.,\n",
       " Question 11. People who live in poverty often have little money to spend on food, and as a result are often afflicted with malnutrition. Ironically, these same people have very high rates of obesity.\n",
       " Answer A. Obesity is becoming a serious problem all over the world and at all levels of income.\n",
       " Answer B. People who live in poverty do not understand the basic rules of nutrition.\n",
       " Answer C. American citizens have gotten out of the habit of cooking family meals, and as a result, fewer and fewer people know how to prepare healthy foods such as vegetables.\n",
       " Answer D. The cheap foods that make up the majority of the diets of poor people are full of calories but devoid of essential nutrients.\n",
       " Answer E. Recent statistics show that processed foods and fast food make up almost half the diet of a large number of people in the United States.,\n",
       " Question 12. Most players of video games are male. Therefore, video game manufacturers should not bother making any games aimed at girls or women.\n",
       " Answer A. Most avid cyclists are male. Therefore, bicycle manufacturers should make most of their bike frames to fit men.\n",
       " Answer B. Most Americans have cellular telephones. Therefore, most Americans should not bother to maintain normal land-based telephones.\n",
       " Answer C. Most people use Windows computers. Therefore, software producers should not bother to make any software for Macintosh computers.\n",
       " Answer D. Most lawyers need glasses or contact lenses. Therefore, optometrists should aim some of their advertising at the legal profession.\n",
       " Answer E. Most Labrador retrievers are easy to train. Therefore, a person who wants an obedient dog should consider getting a Labrador retriever.,\n",
       " Question 1. The legislature is considering a law banning the use of cellphones by people who are driving a moving car. Drivers talking on cellphones are distracted by their phone conversations and can’t give their full attention to driving their vehicles. Banning the use of cellphones by drivers will make the roads safer.\n",
       " Answer A. A study by a sociologist has shown that the use of cellphones is occasionally a contributing factor in traffic accidents.\n",
       " Answer B. The proper role of the legislature is to enact laws that protect the safety of drivers and passengers in automobiles.\n",
       " Answer C. Drivers who hold their cellphones in their hands are more distracted than drivers who use a hands-free headset or speakerphone while driving.\n",

For example, on an internet perfume discussion board, one participant posted the message, “Azkaban arrives today!” referring to an extremely popular film about a boy wizard that was opening that day. Another participant responded, “Where can you buy it?” evidently assuming that “Azkaban” must refer to a new perfume. She quickly realized her mistake, but because her mind was on perfumes, she couldn’t immediately place the movie.\n",
       " Answer A. Internet discussion boards are especially prone to context-based errors.\n",
       " Answer B. Even well-known and widely available information, provided in an unexpected context, can be misleading.\n",

       " Question 7. Divemaster: Some scuba divers fill their tanks with nitrox instead of air. Nitrox is a combination of nitrogen and oxygen that contains more than the usual percentage of oxygen contained in air. Nitrox aficionados claim that the additional oxygen makes diving safer; they can stay down longer, decompress faster, dive again after a shorter surface interval, and feel less fatigued after extended diving than if they were breathing plain air. On the other hand, divers using nitrox face dangers and limitations, particularly the risk of convulsions and death, at greater depths that are safe for divers using air.\n",
       " Answer A. The higher concentration of oxygen in nitrox becomes toxic when it is compressed at increasing depths.\n",
       " Answer B. Divers who use nitrox are likely to stay underwater too long, lulled into a false sense of security by their breathing gas.\n",
       " Answer C. Divers who use air pay more attention to training and safety procedures and experience fewer fatal accidents because of improper procedures than divers who use nitrox.\n",
       " Answer D. All divers face the rare risk of receiving a tank with contaminated air, which occurs when bacteria grow inside a compressor, occasionally resulting in diving fatalities.\n",
       " Answer E. Divers who use nitrox are more likely to dive regularly, take frequent training courses, and buy more technologically advanced equipment than divers who use air.,\n",
       " Question 8. Many Americans do not take all the vacation time to which they are entitled to by their jobs. There are several reasons for this: They feel that they are indispensable at work, they fear the resentment of co-workers, or they dread discovering that their workplaces can actually function perfectly well without them. This is a mistake; vacation time gives workers a chance to rest, recover, and gain perspective that in turn can lead to more creativity and better performance at work.\n",
       " Answer A. It is a recommendation of a policy that the American workplace should implement.\n",

       " Question 9. A large Southern state university has changed its teaching practices. Formerly, instructors without PhDs taught most introductory courses; now professors with PhDs will teach all introductory classes. That means the average class size will increase from 44 students per class to 600 per class, but overall the students’ learning experience should improve.\n",
       " Answer A. Requiring professors with PhDs to teach all introductory classes will mean that the university must hire more faculty with doctorates.\n",
       " Answer B. Students tend to participate in smaller classes more than they do in large lectures, even when the lectures are supplemented by weekly discussion sections.\n",
       " Answer C. Major private universities already have implemented a format in which professors with PhDs teach all introductory classes as large lectures.\n",
       " Answer D. A class taught by a PhD, even in a lecture format with hundreds of students, is a better learning environment than a smaller class taught by an instructor without a PhD.\n",

       " Question 3. Magazine article: Scientists have found that people fall asleep faster when they go to bed with warm feet that cool off as they lie still — for instance, warming one’s feet with socks before going to bed and then removing them when one lies down to sleep to let the feet cool off again. That means that anyone with insomnia should try wearing socks to bed.\n",
       " Answer A. concludes without justification that the technique of warming feet and then letting them cool is a valid approach to preventing sleeplessness\n",
       " Answer B. implies that the same advice will work for all sufferers of insomnia, regardless of the cause\n",

       " Question 11. Legal theorist: It is impossible for the states to regulate obscenity without violating the constitutional guarantee of free speech. U.S. courts have struggled since the 1950s to define obscenity and have for the most part failed to come up with a consistent definition that works reliably. In 1964, Justice Stewart summed up the difficulty of this problem by declining to suggest a definition but stating that, for his part, “I know it when I see it.” Clearly, coming up with a suitable definition of obscenity that does not encroach upon non-obscene speech is unachievable.\n",
       " Answer A. Because defining obscenity at the federal level is impossible, the states should create their own standards of decency tailored to local community preferences.\n",

       " Question 12. No employer wants to face the liability it would incur if a drug-using employee made a serious mistake on the job. The best way to avoid this situation is to require all employees to have their urine tested before hiring and then to perform urine tests on all employees at random times. These urine tests help employers determine which of their employees are regular users of serious drugs such as cocaine, methamphetamines, and heroin.\n",
       " Answer A. Testing a strand of hair is a much more reliable method of identifying those who use serious drugs regularly; residue of illicit drugs remains in hair for three months.\n",
       " Answer B. Urine tests cannot spot cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamines that were taken more than one or two days previously, so weekend drug users can avoid detection fairly easily.\n",
       " Answer C. Random drug testing costs the American workplace many millions every year and only catches a small percentage of those who have consumed drugs.\n",
       " Answer D. Most consumers want to feel sure that the employees of businesses they patronize are not abusing serious drugs on the job.\n",
       " Answer E. Employees can easily cheat on urine tests by purchasing urine from businesses that sell it specifically to help people pass workplace drug tests.,\n",
       " Question 1. Albert, a careful shopper, bought a pair of shoes from a well-known catalog, choosing the catalog based on its guarantee. This guarantee states that the seller will take back any item of merchandise and provide the buyer with either a replacement item or a full refund at any time and for any reason.

       " Answer C. A seller should not make promises that it does not intend to keep because there will always be customers who try to get the maximum value of every dollar by abusing sellers if necessary.\n",
       " Answer D. It is the seller's responsibility to set prices for its merchandise that are sufficient to cover its expenses and generate a profit.\n",
       " Answer E. A seller is obligated to observe the terms of the contract of sale, even if doing so works to the seller's own disadvantage.,\n",
       " Question 2. Abelard: The city should provide more money for public schools. More money would allow the schools to hire more teachers and reduce class sizes from 30 to 25 children, which would result in a better education for all students.\n",
       " Answer A. Schools in Japan typically have between 40 and 45 students per classroom, and the Japanese educational system is widely believed to be excellent.\n",

       " Answer B. When a traveler loses her luggage, she must sometimes hastily buy clothes for business meetings, resulting in great expense.\n",
       " Answer C. Buying new clothes to replace those that were packed in lost luggage is not always possible; for example, passengers who arrive at their destination during a national holiday may have to wait a day or two for shops to open.\n",
       " Answer D. Many holiday travelers plan to shop at their destinations anyway, and losing luggage is a good excuse to buy new clothes.\n",
       " Answer E. Despite the large number of lost bags, airlines only lose the bags of 4 out of every 1,000 passengers, so the odds of arriving without checked luggage are very low.,\n",
       " Question 4. LASIK, or Laser-Assisted in Situ Keratomileusis, is a surgical procedure used to correct vision problems such as nearsightedness. In the procedure, a surgeon cuts a flap from the surface of the patient’s cornea, uses a laser to reshape the middle portion of the cornea, and then replaces the flap. In most cases, LASIK can correct a patient’s vision to near 20/20, eliminating the need for corrective lenses. Patients should be warned, though, that no doctor can guarantee a good result, and they do run the risk of side effects, including loss of vision, severe dry eyes, glare or halos that impair night vision, and loss of depth perception.\n",
       " Answer A. Some patients who undergo LASIK find that they can no longer drive a car at night.\n",
       " Answer B. A prospective LASIK patient must find a surgeon who is experienced in using the LASIK machinery.\n",
       " Answer C. Patients who need reading glasses before undergoing LASIK often still need them after the procedure.\n",
       " Answer D. Even if a patient achieves 20/20 vision after LASIK, his eyesight can still change with age, resulting in imperfect vision once again.\n",
       " Answer E. LASIK is usually successful at improving a patient's vision, but it does not always result in perfect uncorrected eyesight and can create new problems for the patient.,\n",
       " Question 5. Brightly lit high-rise buildings kill approximately 1 billion birds every year. The birds, flying on their migratory paths, become captivated by the lights in the building and fly toward them; they then either crash into the glass, which is invisible to them when interior lights are on, or they fly around and around the source of light until they are exhausted and tumble to the ground. On some mornings, janitors of high-rise buildings must shovel piles of dead birds from the sidewalk. A simple solution is very effective at combating this problem: If a building’s residents simply turn off all interior lights at night, no birds will be attracted to the building.\n",
       " Answer A. Turning on the lights inside a building makes it easier for birds to see the glass windows and avoid flying into them.\n",
       " Answer B. Many tenants of high-rise office buildings habitually leave their interior lights and signs lit up all night.\n",
       " Answer C. In Chicago, two years after most tenants of high-rises agreed to turn off their lights at night, bird mortality fell by 80 percent.\n",
       " Answer D. Rare species such as Kirtland's warbler are vulnerable to running into lighted buildings, which will speed up the eventual extinction of the species.\n",
       " Answer E. Birds running into buildings is only a problem during the birds' migrations between their northern and southern territories, just a few weeks out of the year.,\n",
       " Question 6. Americans blame the outsourcing of jobs to foreign countries for high unemployment today, complaining that companies are taking jobs from U.S. citizens and sending them to other nations, where labor is less expensive. Statistics issued by the U.S. Department of Labor, however, indicate that only 9 percent of layoffs are due to outsourcing, and of that 9 percent, nearly three-quarters of the jobs are moved to other locations within the United States, not to foreign nations.\n",
       " Answer A. Americans who are laid off from their jobs are right to blame the government for encouraging businesses to look abroad for cheaper labor.\n",
       " Answer B. American workers should not worry about losing their jobs to outsourcing.\n",
       " Answer C. Outsourcing of jobs to foreign nations is an inevitable consequence of globalization, as are layoffs of American workers who do jobs that can be performed much more cheaply in other countries.\n",
       " Answer D. Outsourcing to foreign countries is not nearly as important a cause of layoffs as many Americans mistakenly believe.\n",
       " Answer E. Outsourcing of jobs to other locations within the United States does not disrupt the national economy but does benefit one local economy at the expense of another.,\n",
       " Question 7. In many nations throughout the world, child labor is still prevalent. In some countries, more than half of the children under 14 work full time, often in dangerous conditions. This causes a cycle of poverty that is detrimental to the economic development of the countries; child labor is the result of poverty, but it also causes poverty to continue.\n",
       " Answer A. Without a social safety net, poverty-stricken families have no alternative but to send their children to work in menial jobs.\n",
       " Answer B. Many developing nations do not have enough schools to educate all the children born there, so parents choose to send their children to work instead.\n",
       " Answer C. Girls who are forced to work as children tend to grow up with health problems that affect the health and prosperity of their own children.\n",
       " Answer D. Children who work cannot go to school, and without an education, they cannot get high-paying jobs as adults, so their own children are forced to work instead of attending school.\n",
       " Answer E. In some developing nations, the middle and upper class depend on a plentiful supply of cheap servants, usually in the form of young girls from poor families.,\n",
       " Question 8. California has passed a law that will require car manufacturers to drastically reduce the fossil-fuel emissions from automobiles in the next five years. These requirements are far stricter than those imposed by the federal government. Seven other states on both coasts have also passed laws ordering reduced emissions, and several others have announced plans to follow suit. Environmentalists praise the new law, asserting that these states’ efforts will slow global warming.\n",
       " Answer A. States on the coasts are more likely to be interested in environmental issues.\n",
       " Answer B. Reducing fossil-fuel emissions will slow global warming.\n",
       " Answer C. Car manufacturers could have reduced emissions long ago but did not because the law did not force them to.\n",
       " Answer D. Individual states have environmental priorities that are different from those of the federal government.\n",

We believe families are the building blocks of our state, and we want to do everything we can to support them. To help families stay intact, we have designed a brochure that will be distributed to all new mothers and to girls and young women who seek birth control at publicly funded clinics. This brochure emphasizes the importance of the family and informs women that they should finish school, find a job, and get married before having children.\n",

       " Question 1. At least 29 million people used online matchmaking and dating services last year, and that number is expected to increase in the near future, but prospective users of such services should be careful. Far more men than women visit dating sites, which makes it easy for women to find partners but much harder for men. Users can easily lie and claim to be single when in fact they are not. The sites can’t guarantee that no sexual predators will try to use the service. And because users must rely on the honesty of fellow participants in describing themselves, some hopeful daters receive unpleasant shocks when meeting their correspondents for the first time.\n",
       " Answer A. Women who use online dating services face much better odds than men of finding a partner.\n",
       " Answer B. Online dating can be very dangerous because the dating services cannot effectively bar sexual predators from participating.\n",
       " Answer C. Despite the popularity of online dating services, participants should realize that such services come with many potential pitfalls.\n",
       " Answer D. Online dating services should insist that no one who is married or otherwise attached to a partner participate in their programs.\n",

       " Question 2. Art critic: Formalism is an interpretive method that emphasizes the form of an artwork as opposed to its content. Formalist criticism excludes external considerations such as symbolism, history, politics, economics, or authorship, focusing instead on the forms structuring a work of art. Beginning in the 1970s, formalism was often allied to structuralist modes of thinking that sought to understand the workings of an artwork based on its internal properties. The postmodern reaction against formalism in the 1980s largely condemned it on the basis of its disinterest in worldly affairs.\n",
       " Answer A. Everything necessary to comprehend a work of art is contained within that work of art.\n",
       " Answer B. Art appreciation depends on the personal taste of the observer.\n",
       " Answer C. A viewer's pleasure in a work of art emanates from the work of art itself rather than its subject matter.\n",
       " Answer D. An artwork's meaning is dependent on contingent features of the artist's psyche and society rather than on any inherent quality of the work itself.\n",
       " Answer E. Any attempt to deconstruct and subsequently explain an abstract work of art essentially strips it of its intrinsic value.,\n",
       " Question 3. Consumer review: This mail-order catalog claims that its customers save money by buying clothing through it, but the economy it promises is illusory because it only occasionally marks down its normal prices.\n",

       " Question 4. The archaeological findings at level IVa of a bronze-age settlement in Turkey show how the settlement met its end. The village was surrounded by a thick, defensive wall. The findings include a large number of clay vessels sunk in the ground, as though for long-term storage of food during a siege. A number of bronze arrowheads were found, and at least one of the structures seems to have suffered a fire. Therefore, this settlement was clearly destroyed in war, either with its neighbors or with foreign invaders.\n",
       " Answer A. The argument is circular, with the premises taking for granted the truth of the conclusion.\n",

       " Question 5. Oceanographer: The size of oceanic waves is a function of the velocity of the wind and of fetch, the length of the surface of the water subject to those winds. The impact of waves against a coastline is a function of the size of the waves and the shape of the sea bottom. The degree of erosion to which a coastline is subject is a function of the average impact of waves and the geologic composition of the coastline.\n",
       " Answer A. The fetch of winds is related to the shape of the sea bottom.\n",

       " Question 6. Historian: For a historian to assert that one historical event or circumstance caused another is nearly impossible. Given any coherent historical narrative, the sequence of events makes the notion of causation a tempting trap; a subsequent event can seem a necessary outcome of those that preceded it. But this is a mere consequence of the backward-looking perspective of the historian’s art. That one event did in fact happen, and that other events did in fact happen prior to it does not make the subsequent event inevitable or a direct outcome of those that went before.\n",

       " Question 7. Despite five consecutive years in which global consumption of grain has been greater than global production, it is unlikely that the world is facing a near-term crisis in the food supply. The average shortfalls have been mainly due to reduced output from farms in China, which is moving from a policy of central control over agricultural production to a more market-driven model. Therefore, if demand for grain continues to fall short of supply, Chinese production of grain should increase dramatically.\n",
       " Answer A. Global markets respond more slowly than regional markets, so local rates of production usually change more rapidly than the global average.\n",
       " Answer B. When agricultural production is centrally controlled, it is unable to respond to changing demand by adjusting rates of supply.\n",
       " Answer C. Average shortfalls are most readily remedied by local increases in production.\n",
       " Answer D. When agricultural production is market-driven, it is likely to respond to rising demand by increasing production.\n",
       " Answer E. Centrally controlled agricultural production has been shown to be more inefficient than market-driven models.,\n",
       " Question 8. Economist: Health insurers are largely immune to the factors that are limiting profit in many sectors of the healthcare economy. Consumers have shown a willingness to pay almost any price for health insurance premiums. Capital demands, which are the responsibility of doctors and hospitals, are increasing dramatically, even as cost-containment measures, largely encouraged by the insurers and their friends in government, have forced new levels of fiscal discipline upon hospitals and doctors. Patients still need MRIs and buildings to put them in, but hospitals are limited in how much they can charge patients for the use of these facilities.\n",
       " Answer A. It is a specific example of a general condition described in the course of the argument.\n",

       " Question 9. As peer-to-peer (PTP) file-sharing networks flourished, the ability of consumers to download music without paying seriously damaged the prosperity of the recording industry. The numbers speak for themselves. During this time, revenues from sales of CDs in the United States fell by tens of millions of dollars a year, despite the fact that prices for individual CDs kept pace with inflation. Clearly, then, PTP file-sharing was killing the recording industry.\n",
       " Answer A. that all sharing from PTP networks violates copyright\n",
       " Answer B. that no other explanations exist for the decreasing revenues from CD sales\n",
       " Answer C. that the musicians and producers have a right to profit from the distribution of music\n",

       " Question 10. Engineer: In any complex machine on which human life depends, critical systems must have many layers of built-in redundancy. So in designing airplanes, whose control surfaces depend on hydraulic systems for their movement, engineers must include multiple independent redundant systems of hydraulic lines, each capable of giving the pilot control of the airplane’s control surfaces. More redundancy is always better than less, so if an airplane design is deemed relatively safe with three redundant hydraulic systems, it must be deemed safer with four, and safer still with five.\n",
       " Answer A. assumes that redundant systems will not be subject to simultaneous failure\n",
       " Answer B. fails to take into account any practical factors that may limit the number of redundant systems or practical trade-offs involved in increasing levels of redundancy\n",
       " Answer C. focuses on one area — movement of the control surfaces — without taking into account other important considerations of safety\n",
       " Answer D. is limited to a single kind of engineering project and may not be applicable as a general rule\n",
       " Answer E. gives no comprehensive criteria for judging relative levels of safety, according to which you could evaluate its claim that increasing redundancy yields increasing safety,\n",
       " Question 11. Forcing businesses to furnish employees with paid leave for family concerns, such as paternity leave or leave to care for a sick child, is a terrible idea. If a business allows employees to take this time off, the workers will take advantage of the privilege and come to work as little as possible. This will destroy productivity and workplace morale.\n",
       " Answer A. European countries guarantee employees generous family leave and paid vacation time, but the European standard of living is slightly below that of the United States.\n",
       " Answer B. Most male workers refuse to take paternity leave even though it is allowed under federal law and their employers encourage it; they fear they may anger co-workers and harm their chances for promotion if they take time off for what is still seen as a frivolous reason.\n",
       " Answer C. The FMLA requires employers to grant employees 12 weeks a year of unpaid leave for family purposes; although employers save money because the leave is unpaid, they often must spend money to find a replacement for the employee who takes time off.\n",
       " Answer D. In some workplaces, the loss of a single employee at a busy time of year can be devastating, even if that employee plans to return after a few weeks; allowing family leave can overwhelm the employees who stay on the job.\n",
       " Answer E. Allowing employees to take leave for family matters reduces absenteeism, improves morale, and surprisingly increases productivity because the employees who are granted leave tend to work much harder and more efficiently when they come back to work.,\n",
       " Question 12. Casino gambling tends to be detrimental to individuals who live in the county where the casino is located, but paradoxically, it benefits businesses in those same counties. Individual bankruptcy rates in counties with casinos are more than double the national average. Bankruptcy rates for businesses in the same counties are 35 percent lower than the national average.\n",
       " Answer A. Businesses profit from casino gambling because they take in money from local and visiting gamblers, whereas local individuals have more opportunities to lose money gambling.\n",
       " Answer B. Casinos are known to take advantage of gamblers by setting odds in such a way that the casino always makes a profit.\n",
       " Answer C. Counties with casinos have many business opportunities for entrepreneurs who want to open hotels, restaurants, and other service businesses.\n",
       " Answer D. Gambling functions as an addictive disease in many people; they find themselves unable to stop gambling even when they're seriously in debt and must borrow money to continue.\n",
       " Answer E. Counties that vote to allow casinos to open generally are poor counties with high unemployment and low levels of education.,\n",
       " Question 13. Social services worker: We approve of the government’s new policy on food stamps. Instead of issuing actual stamps, the government now provides recipients with debit cards that they can use to buy groceries. Each month their accounts are electronically credited with their allowance, and they can spend the money just as if it were in a bank account but only on specific approved items. This method eliminates the inconvenience and embarrassment associated with food stamps, increases the number of qualified recipients who actually buy food with their allowance, and prevents the type of fraud that was a problem associated with the paper coupons.\n",
       " Answer A. In communities that use the food stamp debit cards, participation in food stamp programs has increased 74 percent since changing to cards from coupons.\n",
       " Answer B. Paper food stamp coupons have long been abused by people who trade them for drugs or weapons at several cents on the dollar.\n",
       " Answer C. The food stamp program is meant to improve nutrition among people with low incomes, and the government has long wanted to make sure program funds are used to buy food.\n",
       " Answer D. People used to have to pick up their paper coupons at a government office once a month, which proved too inconvenient for many people who lacked transportation or free time.\n",
       " Answer E. Some food stamp recipients say they prefer the paper coupons because they can't tell how much money they have in their debit card accounts.,\n",
       " Question 1. Primatologist: We have discovered a new kind of primate in Madagascar, the fat-tailed lemur. These lemurs hibernate, sleeping in holes in trees for up to seven months out of the year. Winter temperatures in Madagascar rarely drop below 86 degrees, so these lemurs do not hibernate to escape the cold but perhaps to conserve energy during the dry season, when food is scarce. This is the first time anyone has found an animal that hibernates during hot weather, disproving the common belief that only animals in cold climates hibernate.\n",
       " Answer A. It challenges the long-held belief that primates never hibernate.\n",
       " Answer B. It accuses scientists who have studied hibernation in the past of wrongfully assuming that hibernation only occurs in cold weather.\n",
       " Answer C. It highlights the importance of this discovery because it disproves a long-held theory about hibernation.\n",
       " Answer D. It calls into question the assumption that this behavior is true hibernation and suggests that it may be something else.\n",
       " Answer E. It sets up a rival theory so that the primatologist can disprove it.,\n",
       " Question 2. Director: I’ve decided to cast the famous American actor Burt Lancaster as the prince in my epic film of the Sicilian classic novel The Leopard. I want him for his star appeal and his massive dignity. The film will be in Italian, but Lancaster can’t speak Italian, so I’ll let him speak his lines in English and then have an Italian actor dub them in Italian. The result will be a seamless Italian film with a famous actor to help sales.\n",
       " Answer A. Italian audiences will refuse to see a film of an Italian classic that does not use an Italian actor in the title role.\n",
       " Answer B. The other actors in the film may object to playing their scenes with a character who cannot speak their language.\n",
       " Answer C. To increase sales, having a famous actor in the title role of a film is more important than having an actor who can speak the film's language.\n",
       " Answer D. Teaching Lancaster enough Italian to allow him to deliver his lines in the correct language would be impossible.\n",
       " Answer E. Lancaster would feel uncomfortable working with a director and crew who did not speak English.,\n",
       " Question 3. Alberto: We should eradicate mosquitoes from the earth. Mosquitoes cause a great deal of harm to humans, transmitting serious diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and encephalitis, and they don’t do anything desirable. Ecologists have found that the loss of a single species from an ecosystem doesn’t usually harm the rest of the ecosystem, so eradicating mosquitoes wouldn’t harm the environment, which of course would be undesirable.\n",
       " Answer A. Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria are responsible for millions of deaths and millions of dollars of lost productivity every year.\n",
       " Answer B. One inevitable consequence of restoring wetlands to their original state is an increase in mosquito populations.\n",
       " Answer C. Mosquitoes have historically kept human and other animal populations down by spreading disease among them.\n",
       " Answer D. Many animals eat mosquitoes and other flying insects.\n",
       " Answer E. The only substances that could eradicate all mosquitoes would also kill off many birds and beneficial insects.,\n",
       " Question 4. Public parks are intended for use by all citizens equally. But when groups such as schools or churches use a park for parties or other organized events, they bring large numbers of people to the park at one time. Therefore, there should be strict rules against large groups using public parks.\n",
       " Answer A. large groups of people may be noisy or become violent\n",
       " Answer B. individuals have complained about large groups of people using public parks\n",

       " Question 5. Employers have recently begun to offer their employees the opportunity to save money for future healthcare or family care expenses in flexible spending accounts, or FSAs. These accounts allow employees to set aside pretax salary income for specific expenses, which can result in a substantial savings on income tax. Surprisingly, though, very few employees have taken advantage of FSAs.\n",
       " Answer A. Insurance companies have started to offer employees debit cards to go with FSAs, which makes it much easier to spend FSA funds.\n",
       " Answer B. Not all employers offer FSAs to their employees.\n",
       " Answer C. Employees can use funds saved in FSAs to pay for over-the-counter drugs and other healthcare costs that are not covered by insurance.\n",
       " Answer D. Funds saved in FSAs must be spent during the plan year or forfeited.\n",
       " Answer E. Employers who move to consumer-driven healthcare plans with high deductibles are finding that more of their employees choose to open FSAs.,\n",
       " Question 6. Many Latin American countries established democratic governments in the past decade. Recently, however, six elected heads of state have been ousted during violent revolutions. A majority of people in those countries, dissatisfied with continuing poverty, have stated that they would install a dictator if he promised to improve economic conditions.\n",
       " Answer A. Some 220 million Latin Americans, nearly half the population of the region, live in grinding poverty without many of the basic necessities of life.\n",
       " Answer B. The governments of these six Latin American countries, though democratically elected, are plagued by corruption and graft.\n",
       " Answer C. A majority of residents of these six Latin American countries do not believe that democracy is necessarily the best form of government for them.\n",
       " Answer D. Weak governments in Latin America are one of the reasons drug trafficking and illegal immigration to the United States have increased in the last decade.\n",

       " Question 7. Years ago people enjoyed homemade eggnog and cookie dough made with raw eggs without fear, but today raw eggs are spoken of as a biohazard, a potential hotbed of salmonella waiting to cause disease and death with the slightest contact. In previous decades, salmonella was generally found on the outside of eggshells, mainly from the eggs having come in contact with the waste products of the chickens who laid them. More recently, however, a growing number of chickens are themselves infected with salmonella, thus allowing the bacterium to be present inside the egg itself. So where once simply washing uncracked eggs protected diners from illness — usually some form of gastrointestinal distress, only rarely fatal — now only cooking eggs thoroughly can guarantee a safe dining experience.\n",
       " Answer A. Salmonella poisoning is on the increase but is rarely fatal.\n",
       " Answer B. The relationship between salmonella and eggs has in fact changed over the years, justifying the recent caution with which people regard raw eggs.\n",
       " Answer C. Some caution is merited when handling raw eggs, although the facts behind salmonella and eggs do not merit extreme levels of caution.\n",
       " Answer D. The risk of food poisoning from eating raw eggs is related to the conditions under which the eggs are produced, which have changed over time.\n",
       " Answer E. The caution with which people regard their food is related to a better understanding of the science behind food poisoning.,\n",
       " Question 8. Software engineers know that a poorly written application can consume more memory than it should and that running out of memory can cause an application to crash. However, if a crashing application causes the whole operating system to crash, the fault lies with the operating system.\n",
       " Answer A. Operating systems with generous amounts of memory are less susceptible to crashing, even when applications are poorly written.\n",
       " Answer B. Operating systems can isolate the memory used by individual applications, even when an application uses a large amount of memory.\n",
       " Answer C. An operating system can monitor an application's consumption of memory and take action when that gets too high.\n",
       " Answer D. Techniques for programming operating systems to catch and handle memory errors are well-defined and well-known among programmers.\n",
       " Answer E. Because many applications can run simultaneously under a single operating system, the operating system should have a well-defined method of managing memory consumption.,\n",
       " Question 9. The document was published under a license that allows others to copy it and disseminate it as long as they do so for noncommercial purposes only. Company A included copies of the document in a training manual that it marketed and sold, arguing that the license was invalid. However, even if the license were proved invalid, the copyright was still valid, leaving Company A with no rights to use the document in any way at all.\n",
       " Answer A. The warranty on the laptop computer claimed to be rendered void if the user opened the case. But the manual that came with the laptop included instructions for opening the case to upgrade the computer's memory. Consumers successfully argued that those instructions constituted an endorsement of users' opening the case and that, therefore, the warranty was not void.\n",
       " Answer B. When the 13-year-olds were caught trying to enter an NC-17 movie at a multiplex, they argued that the cashier at the ticket counter had sold them tickets for that movie. The manager explained that the cashier's error did not change the rules of age limits and movie ratings.\n",
       " Answer C. A restaurant was fined by the Alcoholic Beverage Commission for serving distilled liquors when its license covered only beer and wine. The restaurant's manager argued that he had applied for the proper license and expected to receive it within days. The ABC countered that a license was valid only from the moment the restaurant posted it on the premises.\n",
       " Answer D. Ted's parents have stated that he cannot drive the station wagon unless it is to Alice's house. When his mother saw the station wagon parked at the mall, some miles away, Ted argued that Alice was not at home. Ted's mom pointed out that he ought, upon discovering that fact, to have driven straight home.\n",
       " Answer E. The celebrity sued the magazine for publishing photographs of him sunning himself in his backyard, which was enclosed by a high fence. The magazine claimed that he was a public figure and did not, therefore, have the same rights to privacy as normal citizens. The celebrity claimed that the extensive fence around his yard justified his privacy rights when behind it, despite his prominent stature in the eyes of the public.,\n",
       " Question 10. Scholar: Greek epic poetry emerged as an art form before any of it was ever written down. Singers developed a specialized vocabulary that allowed them to compose poems about the heroes of the Trojan War as they sang them. These poems were neither made up from scratch as the singer sang nor fixed texts that were memorized and repeated verbatim.

       " Question 12. The phrase “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance is not unconstitutional because, throughout our nation’s history, various presidents and political leaders have invoked God in inaugural addresses, Thanksgiving speeches, and other public statements of national unity. Therefore, requiring public school teachers to lead their students in the pledge every day does not force religious beliefs on anyone.\n",
       " Answer A. ignores evidence that many politicians do not invoke God in public addresses because they believe it would be an improper exercise of religion\n",

       " Question 13. Barsad: Europeans work far fewer hours on average than Americans do. Full-time workers in Europe rarely work more than 35 hours a week and take off between four and six weeks every year. This more humane work pattern is directly tied to the higher income taxes imposed on Europeans; high taxes reduce the take-home profit of working long hours, which takes away any incentive workers may have to put in more time than necessary to achieve a comfortable standard of living.\n",
       " Answer A. Europeans value leisure much more than Americans do, as evidenced by their shorter workweeks and much more generous vacation policies.\n",
       " Answer B. Europeans work shorter hours than Americans because higher income taxes remove any incentive they may feel to increase their take-home pay by working longer hours.\n",
       " Answer C. Higher income taxes in the United States would inspire Americans to cut back on the hours that they work, which would benefit families and equalize wealth in the nation.\n",
       " Answer D. Despite the fewer hours they spend at work, Europeans have a standard of living that is no more than 25 percent lower than that enjoyed by Americans.\n",
       " Answer E. Some studies have found a correlation between higher taxes and shorter hours, but those studies also found that the taxes accounted for only one-third of the difference in hours between Americans and Europeans.,\n",
       " Question 1. History has shown that people will reduce their consumption of fuel only if they have a financial incentive to do so. For example, in the energy crisis of the 1970s, people drastically lowered their consumption of gasoline. When California suffered its own statewide energy crisis in 2001, the state promised a 20 percent discount on power bills to consumers who reduced their power consumption, and a majority of citizens managed this feat. The government should therefore implement financial incentives to reduce energy consumption, such as taxes on gasoline or rewards for reduced consumption.\n",
       " Answer A. The government should not interfere with energy policies and should instead let the market guide consumption.\n",
       " Answer B. In some cases, citizens have reduced their power consumption even without incentives.\n",

       " Question 2. Requiring public school students to adhere to dress codes or wear uniforms has many benefits. It cuts down on disciplinary problems, reduces theft, and makes it difficult for wealthy students to make fun of poorer ones because of their clothes. Dress codes do reduce individual expression, but a public school doesn’t need to be a training ground for nonconformists. A dress code can work, though, only if all students are required to follow it.\n",
       " Answer A. Public schools should be a forum for individual expression.\n",
       " Answer B. Enforcing conformity on public school students is justifiable.\n",
       " Answer C. The only way to implement a dress code is to assign students an official uniform.\n",

       " Answer B. does not consider the possibility that other optometrists also make defective frames\n",
       " Answer C. criticizes the optometrist's use of a particular technique when making glasses\n",
       " Answer D. jumps to the conclusion that the defect in the glasses must be due to the optometrist's lack of skill\n",
       " Answer E. accuses the optometrist of deliberately sabotaging the glasses,\n",

       " Question 5. Zoologist: I have discovered a gene that controls whether an individual is monogamous. I took a gene from the monogamous prairie vole and implanted it into its more promiscuous relative, the meadow vole. Thereafter, the meadow voles with the new gene became monogamous.\n",
       " Answer A. Studies on humans and other mammals have shown that receptors for the hormone vasopressin play a role in autism, drug addiction, and the formation of romantic attachments.\n",
       " Answer B. Prairie voles typically form lifelong partnerships, which scientists have linked to an increased number of receptors for the hormone vasopressin.\n",
       " Answer C. Meadow voles live in a harsher environment than prairie voles and cannot afford to pass up opportunities to mate as often as possible.\n",
       " Answer D. The zoologist used a harmless virus to capture the gene and transfer it into the meadow voles.\n",
       " Answer E. The meadow voles that had the prairie vole gene implanted in them were released into and observed in the same habitat in which they had previously lived.,\n",
       " Question 6. An art museum has bought a bronze statue that it believes is a sculpture of the god Apollo by the famous ancient Greek sculptor Praxiteles. Only a few sculptures known to be by Praxiteles still exist today, and many sculptures once thought to be by him were actually copies of his originals made by ancient Romans. Dating ancient sculpture accurately is difficult for scholars, but they have found several features of this statue that make it likely that it dates from the era of Praxiteles, and it certainly conforms to the sculptor’s style.\n",
       " Answer A. The art museum cannot be confident that this statue was made by Praxiteles.\n",
       " Answer B. In some cases, museums have purchased sculptures that they believed were ancient works and later discovered that they were made by modern forgers.\n",
       " Answer C. After extensive research and investigation, scholars will be able to state conclusively whether this statue was made by Praxiteles.\n",
       " Answer D. The statue is certainly an original Greek bronze statue dating from the late fourth century BC or the early third century BC.\n",

       " Question 7. Psychologist A: Psychologists should not refer to the people who participate in their experiments as subjects, which is an extremely impersonal term that could apply as well to rodents. They should instead call them participants, which implies willing consent, except in the case of infants, who of course cannot consent and should be called individuals. This concept has been included in the new guidelines for psychologists who conduct research.\n",

       " Question 1. A recent news story featured a runner whose shoes caught fire just as the runner completed a 100-meter dash. An attendant near the track quickly put out the fire with a fire extinguisher. The story indicated that the friction of the shoes on the track had sparked the fire, but after thinking about it, I questioned why someone would be ready with a fire extinguisher near a track. It must have been a publicity stunt because the runner claimed that this had never happened before.\n",

Voters peruse the life histories, opinions, and personalities of the candidates in order to determine who is best suited for office. Knowing that they have been so carefully scrutinized by the public, candidates can be extremely disheartened if they lose. Some candidates never get over the sense of rejection that comes with losing the race. However, candidates should understand that, in most cases, they are competing with equally qualified and worthy opponents.

The sort of bold, brazen attitude that was manifested by his backwards hat seemed to fluster his opponents. I remember how the children in that little league would wither under his gaze even before he threw his pitches. However, it could also have been his baggy pants that signaled his rebel attitude. I have never really been sure myself, but regardless, those children must have been intimidated by his attitude, because he never lost a game that he pitched. Which of the following if true would tend to support the conclusion of the passage?\n",
       " Answer A. Baggy pants signaled Logan's rebellious attitude just as much as the backwards cap did.\n",

First, each person exercised moderately, going on walks of at least an hour five times a week. Second, none of them consistently used any mind-altering substances like alcohol, tobacco, or any other more serious drug. Lastly, many people gardened. Scientists are uncertain of the effect of gardening on a person's longevity, but apparently it is profound, because otherwise the centenarians as a group would not have been doing it so consistently. To increase my chances of living past 100, I will begin gardening today. Which one of the following is an assumption on which the conclusion is based?\n",
       " Answer A. Taking long walks and abstaining from harmful substances promote good health, and gardening is an inspirational activity.\n",

A person's \"nature\" refers to the set of genes inherited from the person's parents, and a person's \"nurture\" corresponds to the environment in which a person lived while growing up. More than likely this debate will never cease, because it is impossible to separate the effects of nature from those of nurture on a person's development. But someday this argument will end, not because a solution has been found or a consensus reached, but solely because people are without exception tired of arguing about it. Which of the following, if true, most undermines the conclusion of the passage?\n",

It appears, however, that this assumption is wholly unfounded. Dr. Spock, a noted climatologist, stated in a speech earlier this year that the climate change associated with changing seasons is nothing more than an illusion. It makes sense, therefore, that there is really no such thing as a discrepancy in the average temperatures between the different seasons. The major flaw in the reasoning of the passage is that it\n",

       " Question 6. Despite five consecutive years in which global consumption of grain has been greater than global production, it is unlikely that the world is facing a near-term crisis in the food supply. The average shortfalls have been mainly due to reduced output from farms in China, which is moving from a policy of central control over agricultural production to a more market-driven model. Therefore, if demand for grain continues to fall short of supply, Chinese production of grain should increase dramatically. Which one of the following principles most helps to justify this reasoning?\n",
       " Answer A. Global markets respond more slowly than regional markets, so local rates of production usually change more rapidly than the global average.\n",
       " Answer B. When agricultural production is centrally controlled, it is unable to respond to changing demand by adjusting rates of supply.\n",
       " Answer C. Average shortfalls are most readily remedied by local increases in production.\n",
       " Answer D. When agricultural production is market-driven, it is likely to respond to rising demand by increasing production.\n",
       " Answer E. Centrally controlled agricultural production has been shown to be more inefficient than market-driven models.,\n",
       " Question 7. Economist: Health insurers are largely immune to the factors that are limiting profit in many sectors of the healthcare economy. Consumers have shown a willingness to pay almost any price for health insurance premiums. Capital demands, which are the responsibility of doctors and hospitals, are increasing dramatically, even as cost-containment measures, largely encouraged by the insurers and their friends in government, have forced new levels of fiscal discipline upon hospitals and doctors. Patients still need MRIs and buildings to put them in, but hospitals are limited in how much they can charge patients for the use of these facilities. Which one of the following most accurately describes the role that the statement \"patients still need MRIs and buildings to put them in\" plays in the economist's argument?\n",
       " Answer A. It is a specific example of a general condition described in the course of the argument.\n",
       " Answer B. It is used to counter a consideration that may be taken to undermine the argument.\n",
       " Answer C. It is used to indirectly support the claim made by the argument.\n",

       " Question 8. As peer-to-peer (PTP) file-sharing networks flourished, the ability of consumers to download music without paying seriously damaged the prosperity of the recording industry. The numbers speak for themselves. During this time, revenues from sales of CDs in the United States fell by tens of millions of dollars a year, despite the fact that prices for individual CDs kept pace with inflation. Clearly, then, PTP file-sharing was killing the recording industry. The argument depends on assuming which one of the following?\n",
       " Answer A. that all sharing from PTP networks violates copyright\n",
       " Answer B. that no other explanations exist for the decreasing revenues from CD sales\n",
       " Answer C. that the musicians and producers have a right to profit from the distribution of music\n",
       " Answer D. that people who download music would otherwise have purchased it on CD\n",
       " Answer E. that a complex relationship exists between file-sharing and the market in music, both online and on CD,\n",
       " Question 9. Engineer: In any complex machine on which human life depends, critical systems must have many layers of built-in redundancy. So in designing airplanes, whose control surfaces depend on hydraulic systems for their movement, engineers must include multiple independent redundant systems of hydraulic lines, each capable of giving the pilot control of the airplane's control surfaces. More redundancy is always better than less, so if an airplane design is deemed relatively safe with three redundant hydraulic systems, it must be deemed safer with four, and safer still with five. The engineer's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it\n",
       " Answer A. assumes that redundant systems will not be subject to simultaneous failure\n",
       " Answer B. fails to take into account any practical factors that may limit the number of redundant systems or practical trade-offs involved in increasing levels of redundancy\n",
       " Answer C. focuses on one area — movement of the control surfaces — without taking into account other important considerations of safety\n",
       " Answer D. is limited to a single kind of engineering project and may not be applicable as a general rule\n",
       " Answer E. gives no comprehensive criteria for judging relative levels of safety, according to which you could evaluate its claim that increasing redundancy yields increasing safety 9. Forcing businesses to furnish employees with paid leave for family concerns, such as paternity leave or leave to care for a sick child, is a terrible idea. If a business allows employees to take this time off, the workers will take advantage of the privilege and come to work as little as possible. This will destroy productivity and workplace morale.,\n",
       " Question 10. Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\n",
       " Answer A. European countries guarantee employees generous family leave and paid vacation time, but the European standard of living is slightly below that of the United States.\n",
       " Answer B. Most male workers refuse to take paternity leave even though it is allowed under federal law and their employers encourage it; they fear they may anger co-workers and harm their chances for promotion if they take time off for what is still seen as a frivolous reason.\n",
       " Answer C. The FMLA requires employers to grant employees 12 weeks a year of unpaid leave for family purposes; although employers save money because the leave is unpaid, they often must spend money to find a replacement for the employee who takes time off.\n",
       " Answer D. In some workplaces, the loss of a single employee at a busy time of year can be devastating, even if that employee plans to return after a few weeks; allowing family leave can overwhelm the employees who stay on the job.\n",
       " Answer E. Allowing employees to take leave for family matters reduces absenteeism, improves morale, and surprisingly increases productivity because the employees who are granted leave tend to work much harder and more efficiently when they come back to work.,\n",
       " Question 11. Casino gambling tends to be detrimental to individuals who live in the county where the casino is located, but paradoxically, it benefits businesses in those same counties. Individual bankruptcy rates in counties with casinos are more than double the national average. Bankruptcy rates for businesses in the same counties are 35 percent lower than the national average. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain this apparent paradox?\n",
       " Answer A. Businesses profit from casino gambling because they take in money from local and visiting gamblers, whereas local individuals have more opportunities to lose money gambling.\n",
       " Answer B. Casinos are known to take advantage of gamblers by setting odds in such a way that the casino always makes a profit.\n",
       " Answer C. Counties with casinos have many business opportunities for entrepreneurs who want to open hotels, restaurants, and other service businesses.\n",
       " Answer D. Gambling functions as an addictive disease in many people; they find themselves unable to stop gambling even when they're seriously in debt and must borrow money to continue.\n",
       " Answer E. Counties that vote to allow casinos to open generally are poor counties with high unemployment and low levels of education.,\n",
       " Question 12. Social services worker: We approve of the government's new policy on food stamps. Instead of issuing actual stamps, the government now provides recipients with debit cards that they can use to buy groceries. Each month their accounts are electronically credited with their allowance, and they can spend the money just as if it were in a bank account but only on specific approved items. This method eliminates the inconvenience and embarrassment associated with food stamps, increases the number of qualified recipients who actually buy food with their allowance, and prevents the type of fraud that was a problem associated with the paper coupons. All of the following, if true, help to support the position of the social services worker\n",
       " Answer A. In communities that use the food stamp debit cards, participation in food stamp programs has increased 74 percent since changing to cards from coupons.\n",
       " Answer B. Paper food stamp coupons have long been abused by people who trade them for drugs or weapons at several cents on the dollar.\n",
       " Answer C. The food stamp program is meant to improve nutrition among people with low incomes, and the government has long wanted to make sure program funds are used to buy food.\n",
       " Answer D. People used to have to pick up their paper coupons at a government office once a month, which proved too inconvenient for many people who lacked transportation or free time.\n",
       " Answer E. Some food stamp recipients say they prefer the paper coupons because they can't tell how much money they have in their debit card accounts.,\n",
       " Question 1. Primatologist: We have discovered a new kind of primate in Madagascar, the fat-tailed lemur. These lemurs hibernate, sleeping in holes in trees for up to seven months out of the year. Winter temperatures in Madagascar rarely drop below 86 degrees, so these lemurs do not hibernate to escape the cold but perhaps to conserve energy during the dry season, when food is scarce. This is the first time anyone has found an animal that hibernates during hot weather, disproving the common belief that only animals in cold climates hibernate. Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the primatologist's argument by the assertion that this is the first time anyone has found an animal that hibernates during hot weather?\n",
       " Answer A. It challenges the long-held belief that primates never hibernate.\n",
       " Answer B. It accuses scientists who have studied hibernation in the past of wrongfully assuming that hibernation only occurs in cold weather.\n",
       " Answer C. It highlights the importance of this discovery because it disproves a long-held theory about hibernation.\n",
       " Answer D. It calls into question the assumption that this behavior is true hibernation and suggests that it may be something else.\n",
       " Answer E. It sets up a rival theory so that the primatologist can disprove it.,\n",
       " Question 2. Director:I've decided to cast the famous American actor Burt Lancaster as the prince in my epic film of the Sicilian classic novel The Leopard. I want him for his star appeal and his massive dignity. The film will be in Italian, but Lancaster can't speak Italian, so I'll let him speak his lines in English and then have an Italian actor dub them in Italian. The result will be a seamless Italian film with a famous actor to help sales. Which one of the following is an assumption on which the director's argument depends?\n",
       " Answer A. Italian audiences will refuse to see a film of an Italian classic that does not use an Italian actor in the title role.\n",
       " Answer B. The other actors in the film may object to playing their scenes with a character who cannot speak their language.\n",
       " Answer C. To increase sales, having a famous actor in the title role of a film is more important than having an actor who can speak the film's language.\n",
       " Answer D. Teaching Lancaster enough Italian to allow him to deliver his lines in the correct language would be impossible.\n",
       " Answer E. Lancaster would feel uncomfortable working with a director and crew who did not speak English.,\n",
       " Question 3. George: We should eradicate mosquitoes from the earth. Mosquitoes cause a great deal of harm to humans, transmitting serious diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and encephalitis, and they don't do anything desirable. Ecologists have found that the loss of a single species from an ecosystem doesn't usually harm the rest of the ecosystem, so eradicating mosquitoes wouldn't harm the environment, which of course would be undesirable. Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken George's argument?\n",
       " Answer A. Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria are responsible for millions of deaths and millions of dollars of lost productivity every year.\n",
       " Answer B. One inevitable consequence of restoring wetlands to their original state is an increase in mosquito populations.\n",
       " Answer C. Mosquitoes have historically kept human and other animal populations down by spreading disease among them.\n",
       " Answer D. Many animals eat mosquitoes and other flying insects.\n",
       " Answer E. The only substances that could eradicate all mosquitoes would also kill off many birds and beneficial insects.,\n",
       " Question 4. Public parks are intended for use by all citizens equally. But when groups such as schools or churches use a park for parties or other organized events, they bring large numbers of people to the park at one time. Therefore, there should be strict rules against large groups using public parks. The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument takes for granted that\n",
       " Answer A. large groups of people may be noisy or become violent\n",
       " Answer B. individuals have complained about large groups of people using public parks\n",
       " Answer C. public parks are designed with use by organized groups in mind\n",
       " Answer D. members of organized groups, like other individuals, pay taxes that support public parks\n",
       " Answer E. large numbers of people coming to a park prevent individuals from enjoying use of the park,\n",
       " Question 5. Employers have recently begun to offer their employees the opportunity to save money for future healthcare or family care expenses in flexible spending accounts, or FSAs. These accounts allow employees to set aside pretax salary income for specific expenses, which can result in a substantial savings on income tax. Surprisingly, though, very few employees have taken advantage of FSAs. Which one of the following, if true, contributes most to an explanation of why few employees have chosen to save money in FSAs?\n",
       " Answer A. Insurance companies have started to offer employees debit cards to go with FSAs, which makes it much easier to spend FSA funds.\n",
       " Answer B. Not all employers offer FSAs to their employees.\n",
       " Answer C. Employees can use funds saved in FSAs to pay for over-the-counter drugs and other healthcare costs that are not covered by insurance.\n",
       " Answer D. Funds saved in FSAs must be spent during the plan year or forfeited.\n",
       " Answer E. Employers who move to consumer-driven healthcare plans with high deductibles are finding that more of their employees choose to open FSAs.,\n",
       " Question 6. Many Latin American countries established democratic governments in the past decade. Recently, however, six elected heads of state have been ousted during violent revolutions. A majority of people in those countries, dissatisfied with continuing poverty, have stated that they would install a dictator if he promised to improve economic conditions. These statements, if true, most strongly support which one of the following conclusions?\n",
       " Answer A. Some 220 million Latin Americans, nearly half the population of the region, live in grinding poverty without many of the basic necessities of life.\n",
       " Answer B. The governments of these six Latin American countries, though democratically elected, are plagued by corruption and graft.\n",
       " Answer C. A majority of residents of these six Latin American countries do not believe that democracy is necessarily the best form of government for them.\n",
       " Answer D. Weak governments in Latin America are one of the reasons drug trafficking and illegal immigration to the United States have increased in the last decade.\n",

       " Question 7. Years ago people enjoyed homemade eggnog and cookie dough made with raw eggs without fear, but today raw eggs are spoken of as a biohazard, a potential hotbed of salmonella waiting to cause disease and death with the slightest contact. In previous decades, salmonella was generally found on the outside of eggshells, mainly from the eggs having come in contact with the waste products of the chickens who laid them. More recently, however, a growing number of chickens are themselves infected with salmonella, thus allowing the bacterium to be present inside the egg itself. So where once simply washing uncracked eggs protected diners from illness — usually some form of gastrointestinal distress, only rarely fatal — now only cooking eggs thoroughly can guarantee a safe dining experience. Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion of the argument?\n",
       " Answer A. Salmonella poisoning is on the increase but is rarely fatal.\n",
       " Answer B. The relationship between salmonella and eggs has in fact changed over the years, justifying the recent caution with which people regard raw eggs.\n",
       " Answer C. Some caution is merited when handling raw eggs, although the facts behind salmonella and eggs do not merit extreme levels of caution.\n",
       " Answer D. The risk of food poisoning from eating raw eggs is related to the conditions under which the eggs are produced, which have changed over time.\n",
       " Answer E. The caution with which people regard their food is related to a better understanding of the science behind food poisoning.,\n",
       " Question 8. Software engineers know that a poorly written application can consume more memory than it should and that running out of memory can cause an application to crash. However, if a crashing application causes the whole operating system to crash, the fault lies with the operating system. Which one of the following, if true, is least helpful in establishing that this conclusion is properly drawn?\n",
       " Answer A. Operating systems with generous amounts of memory are less susceptible to crashing, even when applications are poorly written.\n",
       " Answer B. Operating systems can isolate the memory used by individual applications, even when an application uses a large amount of memory.\n",
       " Answer C. An operating system can monitor an application's consumption of memory and take action when that gets too high.\n",
       " Answer D. Techniques for programming operating systems to catch and handle memory errors are well-defined and well-known among programmers.\n",
       " Answer E. Because many applications can run simultaneously under a single operating system, the operating system should have a well-defined method of managing memory consumption.,\n",
       " Question 9. The document was published under a license that allows others to copy it and disseminate it as long as they do so for noncommercial purposes only. Company A included copies of the document in a training manual that it marketed and sold, arguing that the license was invalid. However, even if the license were proved invalid, the copyright was still valid, leaving Company A with no rights to use the document in any way at all. Which one of the following situations best demonstrates the principle illustrated by this argument?\n",
       " Answer A. The warranty on the laptop computer claimed to be rendered void if the user opened the case. But the manual that came with the laptop included instructions for opening the case to upgrade the computer's memory. Consumers successfully argued that those instructions constituted an endorsement of users' opening the case and that, therefore, the warranty was not void.\n",
       " Answer B. When the 13-year-olds were caught trying to enter an NC-17 movie at a multiplex, they argued that the cashier at the ticket counter had sold them tickets for that movie. The manager explained that the cashier's error did not change the rules of age limits and movie ratings.\n",
       " Answer C. A restaurant was fined by the Alcoholic Beverage Commission for serving distilled liquors when its license covered only tool and wine. The restaurant's manager argued that he had applied for the proper license and expected to receive it within days. The ABC countered that a license was valid only from the moment the restaurant posted it on the premises.\n",
       " Answer D. Ted's parents have stated that he cannot drive the station wagon unless it is to Alice's house. When his mother saw the station wagon parked at the mall, some miles away, Ted argued that Alice was not at home. Ted's mom pointed out that he ought, upon discovering that fact, to have driven straight home.\n",
       " Answer E. The celebrity sued the magazine for publishing photographs of him sunning himself in his backyard, which was enclosed by a high fence. The magazine claimed that he was a public figure and did, therefore, have the same rights to privacy as normal citizens. The celebrity claimed that the extensive fence around his yard justified his privacy rights when behind it, despite his prominent stature in the eyes of the public.,\n",
       " Question 10. Scholar:Greek epic poetry emerged as an art form before any of it was ever written down. Singers developed a specialized vocabulary that allowed them to compose poems about the heroes of the Trojan War as they sang them. These poems were neither made up from scratch as the singer sang nor fixed texts that were memorized and repeated verbatim. Even after written texts were created that captured these orally composed poems, the tradition continued to evolve, with written texts of the same poem differing from place to place and from time to time, according to the circumstances of their production and the interests of their creators and their intended audiences. If the scholar's statements are true, which one of the following must be true?\n",
       " Answer A. Each written edition derived from the first written version of an orally composed epic.\n",
       " Answer B. No single written edition of a Greek epic can claim to represent the \"original\" version.\n",
       " Answer C. The poems inevitably grew longer and more narratologically complex over the centuries.\n",
       " Answer D. The tradition of composing epics orally died away as the poems came to be written down.\n",
       " Answer E. The older editions of the poems were less likely to have been influenced by local politics than subsequent editions.,\n",
       " Question 11. Curator: This museum does not grant people the right to use images of items in its collection in online publications. We are obliged to do everything in our power to ensure the continued appeal of visiting our collection in person. The curator's argument depends on assuming which one of the following?\n",
       " Answer A. Taking photographs of art objects, especially using a flash, can damage the objects by accelerating the fading of paint.\n",
       " Answer B. The museum sells pictures of its collection in its gift shop, which is an important source of income for the museum.\n",
       " Answer C. Images placed online are easily copied and reused by other people.\n",
       " Answer D. The quality of most electronic images, especially those online, falls short of the professional standards of the museum.\n",

       " Question 12. Career counselor: Many large international companies have changed their practices regarding international assignments. They are placing much more emphasis on helping spouses of expatriate employees to adjust to the foreign environment. This has reduced premature returns by 67 percent. Which one of the following is an assumption upon which the career counselor's argument depends?\n",
       " Answer A. Spousal and marital difficulties were formerly responsible for a large number of premature returns from foreign assignments.\n",
       " Answer B. When an employee is placed in a foreign assignment for a year or less, his or her family sees the assignment as an adventure.\n",
       " Answer C. Expatriate employees work long hours and travel a great deal, and their children make new friends at school, but spouses often have no friends and no work to support them while they're abroad.\n",
       " Answer D. The majority of international assignments today last for less than a year, but ten years ago, 70 percent of them lasted much longer than one year.\n",

Criminals hide behind screen names when perpe-trating their crimes and feel safe from apprehen-sion and punishment in doing so because other Internet users cannot learn their true identities, and jurisdictional and budget issues make it diffi-cult for law enforcement agencies to enforce existing laws. Clearly, the only way to reduce such crime in the future is to create a system that requires Internet users to provide their true iden-tities and full contact information in a way that is visible to all other users.\n",
       " Answer A. Software companies report that they are losing millions of dollars to software piracy. Most such unauthorized reproduction and use of software occurs in countries that do not honor international intellectual property law. Pirates in those countries feel safe ignoring international law since they are beyond the reach of international authorities. Obviously, there would be more incentive for new software development worldwide if such countries would cooperate with international authorities in identifying those software pirates who operate within their borders.\n",
       " Answer B. Crimes involving deception are on the increase at the same time that crimes of violence seem to be decreasing. Law enforcement techniques in the past have focused primarily on the prevention and detection of violent crime. However, it is now clear that new techniques are required to combat crimes such as Internet fraud. Law enforcement agencies will have to focus on recruiting, hiring, and training a larger proportion of computer literate officers if they hope to keep up with modern criminals.\n",
       " Answer C. Wildlife biologists report that the population of the Northern Rock Fish is reaching dangerously low levels. The decrease in population is attributed to over fishing by unethical anglers who ignore laws regulating the size and number of the species that may be taken from rivers and streams. Poachers know that there are insufficient numbers of enforcement officers to create a credible threat of apprehension. It is obvious to authorities that the only way to save the species is to implement a total ban on the fishing of Northern Rock Fish immediately.\n",
       " Answer D. Most states carefully regulate the possession of exotic wild animals as pets. Specially trained officers often raid illicit breeding operations and seize proscribed animals such as chimpanzees and tigers. Although these species are capable of becoming dangerous, individuals are still drawn to them as pets. The fact that their possession is unlawful is an inadequate deterrent. Since prohibitions on owner-ship are clearly not eliminating the black market in exotic species, the focus should turn to education of the public regarding the dangers of such pets.\n",
       " Answer E. When surveyed in prison, the majority of convicted violent criminals report that they have made decisions during their criminal careers to avoid at least one potential victim because of fears that the potential victim might be armed. Even when the criminals themselves are armed, they tend to prefer unarmed victims. Add to this the fact that statistics reveal that complete bans on private weapons in some jurisdictions have failed to eliminate violent crime and the fact that many jurisdictions with a high proportion of private weapon ownership enjoy a very low crime rate, and one may conclude that public policy should favor the private ownership of weapons.,\n",

       " Question 6. Legal theorist: It is impossible for the states to regulate obscenity without violating the constitutional guarantee of free speech. U.S. courts have struggled since the 1950s to define obscenity and have for the most part failed to come up with a consistent definition that works reliably. In 1964, Justice Stewart summed up the difficulty of this problem by declining to suggest a definition but stating that, for his part, \"I know it when I see it.\" Clearly, coming up with a suitable definition of obscenity that does not encroach upon non-obscene speech is unachievable.\n",

       " Question 7. No employer wants to face the liability it would incur if a drug-using employee made a serious mistake on the job. The best way to avoid this situation is to require all employees to have their urine tested before hiring and then to perform urine tests on all employees at random times. These urine tests help employers determine which of their employees are regular users of serious drugs such as cocaine, methamphetamines, and heroin.\n",
       " Answer A. Testing a strand of hair is a much more reliable method of identifying those who use serious drugs regularly; residue of illicit drugs remains in hair for three months.\n",
       " Answer B. Urine tests cannot spot cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamines that were taken more than one or two days previously, so weekend drug users can avoid detection fairly easily.\n",
       " Answer C. Random drug testing costs the American workplace many millions every year and only catches a small percentage of those who have consumed drugs.\n",

       " Answer A. Airlines advise passengers to pack a small carry-on bag containing essential medicines, eyeglasses or contact lenses, toiletries, and a change of clothes.\n",
       " Answer B. When a traveler loses her luggage, she must sometimes hastily buy clothes for business meetings, resulting in great expense.\n",
       " Answer C. Buying new clothes to replace those that were packed in lost luggage is not always possible; for example, passengers who arrive at their destination during a national holiday may have to wait a day or two for shops to open.\n",
       " Answer D. Many holiday travelers plan to shop at their destinations anyway, and losing luggage is a good excuse to buy new clothes.\n",
       " Answer E. Despite the large number of lost bags, airlines only lose the bags of 4 out of every 1,000 passengers, so the odds of arriving without checked luggage are very low.,\n",
       " Question 1. LASIK, or Laser-Assisted in Situ Keratomileusis, is a surgical procedure used to correct vision problems such as nearsightedness. In the procedure, a surgeon cuts a flap from the surface of the patient's cornea, uses a laser to reshape the middle portion of the cornea, and then replaces the flap. In most cases, LASIK can correct a patient's vision to near 20/20, eliminating the need for corrective lenses. Patients should be warned, though, that no doctor can guarantee a good result, and they do run the risk of side effects, including loss of vision, severe dry eyes, glare or halos that impair night vision, and loss of depth perception.\n",
       " Answer A. Some patients who undergo LASIK find that they can no longer drive a car at night.\n",
       " Answer B. A prospective LASIK patient must find a surgeon who is experienced in using the LASIK machinery.\n",

       " Answer D. Even if a patient achieves 20/20 vision after LASIK, his eyesight can still change with age, resulting in imperfect vision once again.\n",
       " Answer E. LASIK is usually successful at improving a patient's vision, but it does not always result in perfect uncorrected eyesight and can create new problems for the patient.,\n",
       " Question 2. Brightly lit high-rise buildings kill approximately 1 billion birds every year. The birds, flying on their migratory paths, become captivated by the lights in the building and fly toward them; they then either crash into the glass, which is invisible to them when interior lights are on, or they fly around and around the source of light until they are exhausted and tumble to the ground. On some mornings, janitors of high-rise buildings must shovel piles of dead birds from the sidewalk. A simple solution is very effective at combating this problem: If a building's residents simply turn off all interior lights at night, no birds will be attracted to the building.\n",
       " Answer A. Turning on the lights inside a building makes it easier for birds to see the glass windows and avoid flying into them.\n",
       " Answer B. Many tenants of high-rise office buildings habitually leave their interior lights and signs lit up all night.\n",
       " Answer C. In Chicago, two years after most tenants of high-rises agreed to turn off their lights at night, bird mortality fell by 80 percent.\n",
       " Answer D. Rare species such as Kirtland's warbler are vulnerable to running into lighted buildings, which will speed up the eventual extinction of the species.\n",

       " Question 3. Americans blame the outsourcing of jobs to foreign countries for high unemployment today, complaining that companies are taking jobs from U.S. citizens and sending them to other nations, where labor is less expensive. Statistics issued by the U.S. Department of Labor, however, indicate that only 9 percent of layoffs are due to outsourcing, and of that 9 percent, nearly three-quarters of the jobs are moved to other locations within the United States, not to foreign nations.\n",
       " Answer A. Americans who are laid off from their jobs are right to blame the government for encouraging businesses to look abroad for cheaper labor.\n",
       " Answer B. American workers should not worry about losing their jobs to outsourcing.\n",
       " Answer C. Outsourcing of jobs to foreign nations is an inevitable consequence of globalization, as are layoffs of American workers who do jobs that can be performed much more cheaply in other countries.\n",
       " Answer D. Outsourcing to foreign countries is not nearly as important a cause of layoffs as many Americans mistakenly believe.\n",
       " Answer E. Outsourcing of jobs to other locations within the United States does not disrupt the national economy but does benefit one local economy at the expense of another.,\n",
       " Question 4. In many nations throughout the world, child labor is still prevalent. In some countries, more than half of the children under 14 work full time, often in dangerous conditions. This causes a cycle of poverty that is detrimental to the economic development of the countries; child labor is the result of poverty, but it also causes poverty to continue.\n",
       " Answer A. Without a social safety net, poverty-stricken families have no alternative but to send their children to work in menial jobs.\n",
       " Answer B. Many developing nations do not have enough schools to educate all the children born there, so parents choose to send their children to work instead.\n",
       " Answer C. Girls who are forced to work as children tend to grow up with health problems that affect the health and prosperity of their own children.\n",
       " Answer D. Children who work cannot go to school, and without an education, they cannot get high-paying jobs as adults, so their own children are forced to work instead of attending school.\n",
       " Answer E. In some developing nations, the middle and upper class depend on a plentiful supply of cheap servants, usually in the form of young girls from poor families.,\n",
       " Question 5. California has passed a law that will require car manufacturers to drastically reduce the fossil-fuel emissions from automobiles in the next five years.

       " Question 10. At least 29 million people used online matchmaking and dating services last year, and that number is expected to increase in the near future, but prospective users of such services should be careful. Far more men than women visit dating sites, which makes it easy for women to find partners but much harder for men. Users can easily lie and claim to be single when in fact they are not. The sites can't guarantee that no sexual predators will try to use the service. And because users must rely on the honesty of fellow participants in describing themselves, some hopeful daters receive unpleasant shocks when meeting their correspondents for the first time.\n",
       " Answer A. Women who use online dating services face much better odds than men of finding a partner.\n",

       " Question 1. Art critic: Formalism is an interpretive method that emphasizes the form of an artwork as opposed to its content. Formalist criticism excludes external considerations such as symbolism, history, politics, economics, or authorship, focusing instead on the forms structuring a work of art. Beginning in the 1970s, formalism was often allied to structuralist modes of thinking that sought to understand the workings of an artwork based on its internal properties. The postmodern reaction against formalism in the 1980s largely condemned it on the basis of its disinterest in worldly affairs.\n",
       " Answer A. Everything necessary to comprehend a work of art is contained within that work of art.\n",
       " Answer B. Art appreciation depends on the personal taste of the observer.\n",

       " Question 3. The archaeological findings at level IVa of a bronze-age settlement in Turkey show how the settlement met its end. The village was surrounded by a thick, defensive wall. The findings include a large number of clay vessels sunk in the ground, as though for long-term storage of food during a siege. A number of bronze arrowheads were found, and at least one of the structures seems to have suffered a fire. Therefore, this settlement was clearly destroyed in war, either with its neighbors or with foreign invaders.\n",

       " Answer B. The evidence is varied, but the conclusion is unified and therefore suspect.\n",
       " Answer C. The argument depends on intermediate conclusions, which make the final conclusion invalid.\n",
       " Answer D. The argument makes a historical conclusion but does not give specific dates to support it.\n",
       " Answer E. None of the pieces of evidence point directly to the conclusion, and all of them could lead to different conclusions.,\n",
       " Question 4. Oceanographer: The size of oceanic waves is a function of the velocity of the wind and of fetch, the length of the surface of the water subject to those winds. The impact of waves against a coastline is a function of the size of the waves and the shape of the sea bottom. The degree of erosion to which a coastline is subject is a function of the average impact of waves and the geologic composition of the coastline.\n",
       " Answer A. The fetch of winds is related to the shape of the sea bottom.\n",
       " Answer B. The size of oceanic waves will not fluctuate far from an average for any given stretch of ocean.\n",

       " Question 5. Historian: For a historian to assert that one historical event or circumstance caused another is nearly impossible. Given any coherent historical narrative, the sequence of events makes the notion of causation a tempting trap; a subsequent event can seem a necessary outcome of those that preceded it. But this is a mere consequence of the backward-looking perspective of the historian's art. That one event did in fact happen, and that other events did in fact happen prior to it does not make the subsequent event inevitable or a direct outcome of those that went before.\n",

       " Answer D. It is used to explain a consideration that may be taken to undermine the argument's conclusion.\n",
       " Answer E. It is the conclusion that the argument aims to support.,\n",
       " Question 6. Despite five consecutive years in which global consumption of grain has been greater than global production, it is unlikely that the world is facing a near-term crisis in the food supply. The average shortfalls have been mainly due to reduced output from farms in China, which is moving from a policy of central control over agricultural production to a more market-driven model. Therefore, if demand for grain continues to fall short of supply, Chinese production of grain should increase dramatically.\n",
       " Answer A. Global markets respond more slowly than regional markets, so local rates of production usually change more rapidly than the global average.\n",
       " Answer B. When agricultural production is centrally controlled, it is unable to respond to changing demand by adjusting rates of supply.\n",
       " Answer C. Average shortfalls are most readily remedied by local increases in production.\n",
       " Answer D. When agricultural production is market-driven, it is likely to respond to rising demand by increasing production.\n",
       " Answer E. Centrally controlled agricultural production has been shown to be more inefficient than market-driven models.,\n",
       " Question 7. Economist: Health insurers are largely immune to the factors that are limiting profit in many sectors of the healthcare economy. Consumers have shown a willingness to pay almost any price for health insurance premiums. Capital demands, which are the responsibility of doctors and hospitals, are increasing dramatically, even as cost-containment measures, largely encouraged by the insurers and their friends in government, have forced new levels of fiscal discipline upon hospitals and doctors. Patients still need MRIs and buildings to put them in, but hospitals are limited in how much they can charge patients for the use of these facilities.\n",
       " Answer A. It is a specific example of a general condition described in the course of the argument.\n",

       " Question 8. As peer-to-peer (PTP) file-sharing networks flourished, the ability of consumers to download music without paying seriously damaged the prosperity of the recording industry. The numbers speak for themselves. During this time, revenues from sales of CDs in the United States fell by tens of millions of dollars a year, despite the fact that prices for individual CDs kept pace with inflation. Clearly, then, PTP file-sharing was killing the recording industry.\n",
       " Answer A. that all sharing from PTP networks violates copyright\n",
       " Answer B. that no other explanations exist for the decreasing revenues from CD sales\n",
       " Answer C. that the musicians and producers have a right to profit from the distribution of music\n",
       " Answer D. that people who download music would otherwise have purchased it on CD\n",

       " Question 9. Engineer: In any complex machine on which human life depends, critical systems must have many layers of built-in redundancy. So in designing airplanes, whose control surfaces depend on hydraulic systems for their movement, engineers must include multiple independent redundant systems of hydraulic lines, each capable of giving the pilot control of the airplane's control surfaces. More redundancy is always better than less, so if an airplane design is deemed relatively safe with three redundant hydraulic systems, it must be deemed safer with four, and safer still with five.\n",
       " Answer A. assumes that redundant systems will not be subject to simultaneous failure\n",
       " Answer B. fails to take into account any practical factors that may limit the number of redundant systems or practical trade-offs involved in increasing levels of redundancy\n",
       " Answer C. focuses on one area — movement of the control surfaces — without taking into account other important considerations of safety\n",
       " Answer D. is limited to a single kind of engineering project and may not be applicable as a general rule\n",
       " Answer E. gives no comprehensive criteria for judging relative levels of safety, according to which you could evaluate its claim that increasing redundancy yields increasing safety,\n",
       " Question 10. Forcing businesses to furnish employees with paid leave for family concerns, such as paternity leave or leave to care for a sick child, is a terrible idea. If a business allows employees to take this time off, the workers will take advantage of the privilege and come to work as little as possible. This will destroy productivity and workplace morale.\n",
       " Answer A. European countries guarantee employees generous family leave and paid vacation time, but the European standard of living is slightly below that of the United States.\n",
       " Answer B. Most male workers refuse to take paternity leave even though it is allowed under federal law and their employers encourage it; they fear they may anger co-workers and harm their chances for promotion if they take time off for what is still seen as a frivolous reason.\n",
       " Answer C. The FMLA requires employers to grant employees 12 weeks a year of unpaid leave for family purposes; although employers save money because the leave is unpaid, they often must spend money to find a replacement for the employee who takes time off.\n",
       " Answer D. In some workplaces, the loss of a single employee at a busy time of year can be devastating, even if that employee plans to return after a few weeks; allowing family leave can overwhelm the employees who stay on the job.\n",
       " Answer E. Allowing employees to take leave for family matters reduces absenteeism, improves morale, and surprisingly increases productivity because the employees who are granted leave tend to work much harder and more efficiently when they come back to work.,\n",
       " Question 1. Casino gambling tends to be detrimental to individuals who live in the county where the casino is located, but paradoxically, it benefits businesses in those same counties. Individual bankruptcy rates in counties with casinos are more than double the national average. Bankruptcy rates for businesses in the same counties are 35 percent lower than the national average.\n",
       " Answer A. Businesses profit from casino gambling because they take in money from local and visiting gamblers, whereas local individuals have more opportunities to lose money gambling.\n",
       " Answer B. Casinos are known to take advantage of gamblers by setting odds in such a way that the casino always makes a profit.\n",
       " Answer C. Counties with casinos have many business opportunities for entrepreneurs who want to open hotels, restaurants, and other service businesses.\n",
       " Answer D. Gambling functions as an addictive disease in many people; they find themselves unable to stop gambling even when they're seriously in debt and must borrow money to continue.\n",
       " Answer E. Counties that vote to allow casinos to open generally are poor counties with high unemployment and low levels of education.,\n",
       " Question 2. Social services worker: We approve of the government's new policy on food stamps. Instead of issuing actual stamps, the government now provides recipients with debit cards that they can use to buy groceries. Each month their accounts are electronically credited with their allowance, and they can spend the money just as if it were in a bank account but only on specific approved items. This method eliminates the inconvenience and embarrassment associated with food stamps, increases the number of qualified recipients who actually buy food with their allowance, and prevents the type of fraud that was a problem associated with the paper coupons.\n",
       " Answer A. In communities that use the food stamp debit cards, participation in food stamp programs has increased 74 percent since changing to cards from coupons.\n",
       " Answer B. Paper food stamp coupons have long been abused by people who trade them for drugs or weapons at several cents on the dollar.\n",
       " Answer C. The food stamp program is meant to improve nutrition among people with low incomes, and the government has long wanted to make sure program funds are used to buy food.\n",
       " Answer D. People used to have to pick up their paper coupons at a government office once a month, which proved too inconvenient for many people who lacked transportation or free time.\n",
       " Answer E. Some food stamp recipients say they prefer the paper coupons because they can't tell how much money they have in their debit card accounts.,\n",
       " Question 3. Primatologist: We have discovered a new kind of primate in Madagascar, the fat-tailed lemur. These lemurs hibernate, sleeping in holes in trees for up to seven months out of the year. Winter temperatures in Madagascar rarely drop below 86 degrees, so these lemurs do not hibernate to escape the cold but perhaps to conserve energy during the dry season, when food is scarce. This is the first time anyone has found an animal that hibernates during hot weather, disproving the common belief that only animals in cold climates hibernate.\n",
       " Answer A. It challenges the long-held belief that primates never hibernate.\n",
       " Answer B. It accuses scientists who have studied hibernation in the past of wrongfully assuming that hibernation only occurs in cold weather.\n",
       " Answer C. It highlights the importance of this discovery because it disproves a long-held theory about hibernation.\n",
       " Answer D. It calls into question the assumption that this behavior is true hibernation and suggests that it may be something else.\n",
       " Answer E. It sets up a rival theory so that the primatologist can disprove it.,\n",
       " Question 4. Director: I've decided to cast the famous American actor Burt Lancaster as the prince in my epic film of the Sicilian classic novel The Leopard. I want him for his star appeal and his massive dignity. The film will be in Italian, but Lancaster can't speak Italian, so I'll let him speak his lines in English and then have an Italian actor dub them in Italian. The result will be a seamless Italian film with a famous actor to help sales.\n",
       " Answer A. Italian audiences will refuse to see a film of an Italian classic that does not use an Italian actor in the title role.\n",
       " Answer B. The other actors in the film may object to playing their scenes with a character who cannot speak their language.\n",
       " Answer C. To increase sales, having a famous actor in the title role of a film is more important than having an actor who can speak the film's language.\n",
       " Answer D. Teaching Lancaster enough Italian to allow him to deliver his lines in the correct language would be impossible.\n",
       " Answer E. Lancaster would feel uncomfortable working with a director and crew who did not speak English.,\n",
       " Question 5. Alberto: We should eradicate mosquitoes from the earth. Mosquitoes cause a great deal of harm to humans, transmitting serious diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and encephalitis, and they don't do anything desirable. Ecologists have found that the loss of a single species from an ecosystem doesn't usually harm the rest of the ecosystem, so eradicating mosquitoes wouldn't harm the environment, which of course would be undesirable.\n",
       " Answer A. Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria are responsible for millions of deaths and millions of dollars of lost productivity every year.\n",
       " Answer B. One inevitable consequence of restoring wetlands to their original state is an increase in mosquito populations.\n",
       " Answer C. Mosquitoes have historically kept human and other animal populations down by spreading disease among them.\n",
       " Answer D. Many animals eat mosquitoes and other flying insects.\n",
       " Answer E. The only substances that could eradicate all mosquitoes would also kill off many birds and beneficial insects.,\n",
       " Question 6. Public parks are intended for use by all citizens equally.

       " Question 7. Employers have recently begun to offer their employees the opportunity to save money for future healthcare or family care expenses in flexible spending accounts, or FSAs. These accounts allow employees to set aside pretax salary income for specific expenses, which can result in a substantial savings on income tax. Surprisingly, though, very few employees have taken advantage of FSAs.\n",
       " Answer A. Insurance companies have started to offer employees debit cards to go with FSAs, which makes it much easier to spend FSA funds.\n",
       " Answer B. Not all employers offer FSAs to their employees.\n",
       " Answer C. Employees can use funds saved in FSAs to pay for over-the-counter drugs and other healthcare costs that are not covered by insurance.\n",
       " Answer D. Funds saved in FSAs must be spent during the plan year or forfeited.\n",
       " Answer E. Employers who move to consumer-driven healthcare plans with high deductibles are finding that more of their employees choose to open FSAs.,\n",
       " Question 8. Many Latin American countries established democratic governments in the past decade. Recently, however, six elected heads of state have been ousted during violent revolutions. A majority of people in those countries, dissatisfied with continuing poverty, have stated that they would install a dictator if he promised to improve economic conditions.\n",
       " Answer A. Some 220 million Latin Americans, nearly half the population of the region, live in grinding poverty without many of the basic necessities of life.\n",

       " Question 9. Years ago people enjoyed homemade eggnog and cookie dough made with raw eggs without fear, but today raw eggs are spoken of as a biohazard, a potential hotbed of salmonella waiting to cause disease and death with the slightest contact. In previous decades, salmonella was generally found on the outside of eggshells, mainly from the eggs having come in contact with the waste products of the chickens who laid them. More recently, however, a growing number of chickens are themselves infected with salmonella, thus allowing the bacterium to be present inside the egg itself. So where once simply washing uncracked eggs protected diners from illness — usually some form of gastrointestinal distress, only rarely fatal — now only cooking eggs thoroughly can guarantee a safe dining experience.\n",
       " Answer A. Salmonella poisoning is on the increase but is rarely fatal.\n",
       " Answer B. The relationship between salmonella and eggs has in fact changed over the years, justifying the recent caution with which people regard raw eggs.\n",
       " Answer C. Some caution is merited when handling raw eggs, although the facts behind salmonella and eggs do not merit extreme levels of caution.\n",
       " Answer D. The risk of food poisoning from eating raw eggs is related to the conditions under which the eggs are produced, which have changed over time.\n",
       " Answer E. The caution with which people regard their food is related to a better understanding of the science behind food poisoning.,\n",
       " Question 10. Software engineers know that a poorly written application can consume more memory than it should and that running out of memory can cause an application to crash.

       " Answer A. Operating systems with generous amounts of memory are less susceptible to crashing, even when applications are poorly written.\n",
       " Answer B. Operating systems can isolate the memory used by individual applications, even when an application uses a large amount of memory.\n",
       " Answer C. An operating system can monitor an application's consumption of memory and take action when that gets too high.\n",
       " Answer D. Techniques for programming operating systems to catch and handle memory errors are well-defined and well-known among programmers.\n",
       " Answer E. Because many applications can run simultaneously under a single operating system, the operating system should have a well-defined method of managing memory consumption.,\n",
       " Question 1. The document was published under a license that allows others to copy it and disseminate it as long as they do so for noncommercial purposes only. Company A included copies of the document in a training manual that it marketed and sold, arguing that the license was invalid. However, even if the license were proved invalid, the copyright was still valid, leaving Company A with no rights to use the document in any way at all.\n",
       " Answer A. The warranty on the laptop computer claimed to be rendered void if the user opened the case. But the manual that came with the laptop included instructions for opening the case to upgrade the computer's memory. Consumers successfully argued that those instructions constituted an endorsement of users' opening the case and that, therefore, the warranty was not void.\n",
       " Answer B. When the 13-year-olds were caught trying to enter an NC-17 movie at a multiplex, they argued that the cashier at the ticket counter had sold them tickets for that movie. The manager explained that the cashier's error did not change the rules of age limits and movie ratings.\n",
       " Answer C. A restaurant was fined by the Alcoholic Beverage Commission for serving distilled liquors when its license covered only beer and wine. The restaurant's manager argued that he had applied for the proper license and expected to receive it within days. The ABC countered that a license was valid only from the moment the restaurant posted it on the premises.\n",

       " Answer E. The celebrity sued the magazine for publishing photographs of him sunning himself in his backyard, which was enclosed by a high fence. The magazine claimed that he was a public figure and did not, therefore, have the same rights to privacy as normal citizens. The celebrity claimed that the extensive fence around his yard justified his privacy rights when behind it, despite his prominent stature in the eyes of the public.,\n",
       " Question 2. Scholar: Greek epic poetry emerged as an art form before any of it was ever written down. Singers developed a specialized vocabulary that allowed them to compose poems about the heroes of the Trojan War as they sang them. These poems were neither made up from scratch as the singer sang nor fixed texts that were memorized and repeated verbatim. Even after written texts were created that captured these orally composed poems, the tradition continued to evolve, with written texts of the same poem differing from place to place and from time to time, according to the circumstances of their production and the interests of their creators and their intended audiences.\n",
       " Answer A. Each written edition derived from the first written version of an orally composed epic.\n",

       " Question 3. To earn a graduate equivalency diploma, a student must pass tests on subjects taught in high schools, proving that he or she has mastered them to the degree assumed of a high school graduate. It makes sense for a student to drop out of high school and earn a GED. A GED takes much less time to earn than a high school diploma and provides evidence that the student has learned everything he or she would have learned in high school.\n",
       " Answer A. Some GED-prep programs incorporate enrichment activities into their test preparation, such as taking students to art exhibits and theatrical performances.\n",
       " Answer B. Most colleges and universities consider a GED equivalent to a high school degree for admission purposes.\n",

       " Question 7. The phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance is not unconstitutional because, throughout our nation's history, various presidents and political leaders have invoked God in inaugural addresses, Thanksgiving speeches, and other public statements of national unity. Therefore, requiring public school teachers to lead their students in the pledge every day does not force religious beliefs on anyone.\n",
       " Answer A. ignores evidence that many politicians do not invoke God in public addresses because they believe it would be an improper exercise of religion\n",
       " Answer B. fails to acknowledge that the majority of U.S. citizens approve of including the phrase \"under God\" in the pledge\n",

       " Question 8. Barsad: Europeans work far fewer hours on average than Americans do. Full-time workers in Europe rarely work more than 35 hours a week and take off between four and six weeks every year. This more humane work pattern is directly tied to the higher income taxes imposed on Europeans; high taxes reduce the take-home profit of working long hours, which takes away any incentive workers may have to put in more time than necessary to achieve a comfortable standard of living.\n",
       " Answer A. Europeans value leisure much more than Americans do, as evidenced by their shorter workweeks and much more generous vacation policies.\n",
       " Answer B. Europeans work shorter hours than Americans because higher income taxes remove any incentive they may feel to increase their take-home pay by working longer hours.\n",
       " Answer C. Higher income taxes in the United States would inspire Americans to cut back on the hours that they work, which would benefit families and equalize wealth in the nation.\n",
       " Answer D. Despite the fewer hours they spend at work, Europeans have a standard of living that is no more than 25 percent lower than that enjoyed by Americans.\n",
       " Answer E. Some studies have found a correlation between higher taxes and shorter hours, but those studies also found that the taxes accounted for only one-third of the difference in hours between Americans and Europeans.,\n",
       " Question 9. History has shown that people will reduce their consumption of fuel only if they have a financial incentive to do so. For example, in the energy crisis of the 1970s, people drastically lowered their consumption of gasoline. When California suffered its own statewide energy crisis in 2001, the state promised a 20 percent discount on power bills to consumers who reduced their power consumption, and a majority of citizens managed this feat. The government should therefore implement financial incentives to reduce energy consumption, such as taxes on gasoline or rewards for reduced consumption.\n",
       " Answer A. The government should not interfere with energy policies and should instead let the market guide consumption.\n",
       " Answer B. In some cases, citizens have reduced their power consumption even without incentives.\n",
       " Answer C. Policies created during the energy crisis of the 1970s should serve as a model of policies that could address the current energy crisis.\n",

       " Answer E. The federal government should follow California's lead in setting energy policy.,\n",
       " Question 10. Requiring public school students to adhere to dress codes or wear uniforms has many benefits. It cuts down on disciplinary problems, reduces theft, and makes it difficult for wealthy students to make fun of poorer ones because of their clothes. Dress codes do reduce individual expression, but a public school doesn't need to be a training ground for nonconformists. A dress code can work, though, only if all students are required to follow it.\n",
       " Answer A. Public schools should be a forum for individual expression.\n",
       " Answer B. Enforcing conformity on public school students is justifiable.\n",
       " Answer C. The only way to implement a dress code is to assign students an official uniform.\n",

       " Question 3. Zoologist: I have discovered a gene that controls whether an individual is monogamous. I took a gene from the monogamous prairie vole and implanted it into its more promiscuous relative, the meadow vole. Thereafter, the meadow voles with the new gene became monogamous.\n",
       " Answer A. Studies on humans and other mammals have shown that receptors for the hormone vasopressin play a role in autism, drug addiction, and the formation of romantic attachments.\n",
       " Answer B. Prairie voles typically form lifelong partnerships, which scientists have linked to an increased number of receptors for the hormone vasopressin.\n",
       " Answer C. Meadow voles live in a harsher environment than prairie voles and cannot afford to pass up opportunities to mate as often as possible.\n",
       " Answer D. The zoologist used a harmless virus to capture the gene and transfer it into the meadow voles.\n",
       " Answer E. The meadow voles that had the prairie vole gene implanted in them were released into and observed in the same habitat in which they had previously lived.,\n",
       " Question 4. An art museum has bought a bronze statue that it believes is a sculpture of the god Apollo by the famous ancient Greek sculptor Praxiteles. Only a few sculptures known to be by Praxiteles still exist today, and many sculptures once thought to be by him were actually copies of his originals made by ancient Romans. Dating ancient sculpture accurately is difficult for scholars, but they have found several features of this statue that make it likely that it dates from the era of Praxiteles, and it certainly conforms to the sculptor's style.\n",
       " Answer A. The art museum cannot be confident that this statue was made by Praxiteles.\n",
       " Answer B. In some cases, museums have purchased sculptures that they believed were ancient works and later discovered that they were made by modern forgers.\n",
       " Answer C. After extensive research and investigation, scholars will be able to state conclusively whether this statue was made by Praxiteles.\n",
       " Answer D. The statue is certainly an original Greek bronze statue dating from the late fourth century BC or the early third century BC.\n",
       " Answer E. Praxiteles's style is so distinctive that it is readily apparent when a statue is one of his originals as opposed to a copy.,\n",
       " Question 5. Psychologist A: Psychologists should not refer to the people who participate in their experiments as subjects, which is an extremely impersonal term that could apply as well to rodents. They should instead call them participants, which implies willing consent, except in the case of infants, who of course cannot consent and should be called individuals. This concept has been included in the new guidelines for psychologists who conduct research.\n",
       " Answer A. those who take part in psychological experiments prefer to be called participants\n",

       " Question 6. Gynecologist: Scottish researchers have developed a test that allows them to predict at what age a woman will experience menopause. The scientists use a model that compares a woman's ovaries to \"average\" ovaries to see whether her ovaries are aging faster or more slowly than average. They have discovered that the size of ovaries is directly related to the number of eggs they contain, which in turn is directly related to fertility. This discovery will significantly influence women's decisions on when to have children.\n",
       " Answer A. Women with smaller ovaries tend to have less success with assisted reproduction techniques, such as in vitro fertilization.\n",
       " Answer B. Most women experience menopause around the age of 50, but their fertility starts to decline at the age of 37.\n",
       " Answer C. Any discovery that allows women to predict when they will experience menopause will influence their decisions on when to have children.\n",
       " Answer D. The test cannot tell women how likely they are to conceive in the years just prior to menopause.\n",
       " Answer E. Every woman is born with several million eggs in her ovaries, which formed while she was a fetus; the number of eggs dwindles over her lifetime, until at menopause she has 1,000 or fewer.,\n",

       " Question 9. During the 20th century, the introduction of widespread indoor plumbing and electricity and the invention of machines such as washing machines and dishwashers made it much easier for women to accomplish their daily housekeeping chores. Ironically, by the 1950s, women actually spent more time doing housework than they had 40 years earlier, before these innovations.\n",
       " Answer A. By the 1950s, people expected cleaner clothes and surroundings and more elaborate meals than they had earlier in the 20th century.\n",

       " Question 1. The ivory-billed woodpecker has been considered extinct for the past several decades. Recently, researchers claim to have found a pair of ivory-billed woodpeckers in Arkansas. Their best evidence is a video that shows a large woodpecker flying away from the camera. The bird has the characteristic large white patches on the trailing edge of the wings. This is one of the factors that distinguishes ivory-billeds from the closely related pileated woodpecker. However, skeptics of the discovery argue that some abnormal pileateds can have extra white on the wing and that the bird in the video is most likely an abnormal pileated. They conclude that the ivory-billed has not been found and is still extinct.\n",
       " Answer A. Before this discovery, the last reported ivory-billed woodpeckers were seen in Louisiana.\n",
       " Answer B. The first person to discover the ivory-billed woodpeckers was not a specialist, but professional ornithologists were soon brought in to confirm the identification.\n",
       " Answer C. In the same area where the video was shot, researchers also heard the distinctive double-tap used by ivory-billed woodpeckers.\n",
       " Answer D. Of the five key field marks that identify ivory-billed woodpeckers, only the extra white on the wings has been seen, and this is also the only feature that occurs on abnormal pileated woodpeckers.\n",

Usually, the police handle crime in the city, the sheriff's department handles county matters, and the state police handle matters that affect the entire state. Therefore, most cities have too much duplication of law enforcement jobs.\n",
       " Answer C. The United States is said to have a free market economy. In fact, though, the U.S. economy is heavily regulated by the government, which gives many advantages to large businesses and punishes small companies and the self-employed. Therefore, the United States does not really have a free market economy.\n",

       " Question 7. Since the late 19th century, German schools have used a series of aptitude tests to shunt students into various tracks, some leading to the university, some to two-year clerical colleges, and some straight to technical jobs. The German educational system is currently plagued with discipline problems and underperforming students. Therefore, aptitude tests are valueless for sorting students.\n",
       " Answer A. Disciplinary and other problems are most profound at technical schools with large immigrant populations, where students feel that society will not give them opportunities for self-improvement.\n",
       " Answer B. Schools that attempt to teach the same subjects to students of all abilities are the most likely to suffer from discipline problems and failure because the work is too easy for bright students and too hard for slower ones.\n",
       " Answer C. Sorting students by ability allows schools to gear curricula to individual needs, which results in better overall results.\n",
       " Answer D. Until the early 1990s, the German school system was one of the best in the world, with excellent test results and virtually no disciplinary problems.\n",
       " Answer E. Students who graduate from German technical schools are usually prepared to perform highly skilled jobs that pay them well.,\n",
       " Question 8. All worker bees are female and have no sense of themselves as individuals. They instead live to further the welfare of the queen and her hive as a whole, helping her to lay eggs and raising her offspring. This means that workers spend their lives helping the queen to pass on her genetic traits and fail to pass on their own genes to offspring.\n",
       " Answer A. All the bees in a hive are related to one another.; the workers are all sisters and the quen is their mother. There is no need for workers to pass on their own genes because they are furthering their mother's line.\n",
       " Answer B. When a hive loses its queen, some workers develop the ability to lay eggs; these unfertilized eggs can hatch only into male drones.\n",
       " Answer C. A bee colony has only one queen at a time. When a new queen hatches in a hive, she immediately seeks out all other queens and tries to kill them or drive them out.\n",
       " Answer D. If a beekeeper can catch the queen from a swarm, he can install her in a beehive, and the entire swarm of worker bees will immediately move into the hive with her.\n",
       " Answer E. Queen bees mate once in their lives and store sperm from this mating to fertilize all their worker eggs. Male drones hatch from unfertilized eggs.,\n",
       " Question 9. Some scholars of mythology claim that myths exist to explain natural phenomena; for example, the myth of Zeus's casting lightning bolts from heaven helped the ancient Greeks explain an otherwise unexplainable event. Other scholars argue that myths are a way in which people explore psychological phenomena, such as a son's feelings toward his mother. If these various scholars are correct, then all myths can be interpreted both as explanations of natural events and explorations of psychology.\n",
       " Answer A. draws a conclusion about myths that has already been discounted by experts in the field\n",
       " Answer B. takes for granted that the myths of ancient people are relevant today\n",
       " Answer C. imposes a modern, western sensibility on the myths of pre-modern people from a variety of cultures\n",

       " Question 10. Identifying the sex of parrotfish can be difficult. Juveniles of both sexes look alike. On the other hand, sexually mature males are large and brightly colored, with brilliantly colored scales that resemble those of colorful tropical parrots, whereas mature females are smaller than males and have more subdued coloration. In some species, males pass through an intermediate growth phase in which they continue to look identical to females before maturing into their full adult size and coloration.\n",
       " Answer A. The sex of a non-juvenile parrotfish lacking brightly colored scales cannot always be easily determined.\n",
       " Answer B. All male parrotfish are large and brightly colored.\n",
       " Answer C. Female parrotfish use the bright colors of male parrotfish to judge which males are good mating prospects.\n",
       " Answer D. Smaller size and subdued coloring help female parrotfish escape predators, to which mature male parrotfish are especially vulnerable.\n",
       " Answer E. In all species of parrotfish, all males spend a part of their lives looking exactly like adult females.]"
